0,"Update: Now that the tech issues have been addressed, changing to 4 stars from 1 star earlier. The checkin functionality is great and also like to call out ability to view incoming flights, often 3-4 flights down. Need to have Altitude Status and progression integrated into the app."
1,Changing my rating since the problems are fixed in new update. Good work Air Canada.
2,App worked pretty much as expected. Could have used terminal maps to know where we were going for our next gate.
3,"Highly recommend when you travel with Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge or AC Express."
4,The app went from very useful to absolutely useless to useful again.
5,Finally fixed! Thank you Air Canada
6,I really like the previous interface. It was a big upgrade from the old app and yet the new interface had some welcome user friendly UI additions. What I don't understand is why some useful features were taken away such as integrating itinerary into the Calendar app and being able to change payment/personal info in the app rather than getting redirected to a browser.
7,"Since they moved to the new platform, the app has improved, but it now shows annoying messages about the need to update, which lead to nowhere, since Google store already made auto update. Otherwise, functionality is there."
8,"Loved the new app interface, definitely innovative and user friendly. The animations are quite smooth. Boarding pass details not only provides pure information but also gives flight status which is pretty helpful."
9,"Love the Air Canada app. Best one I have seen across all the airlines I have been on. Good UI/UX, and excellent view of flights info, boarding pass and my trips"
10,"Much more user friendly than the old one, but still needs some tweaks."
11,Having access to everything I need in one place had made my travel experience second to none!
12,Love that you can track inbound routes. Simple but great.
13,Booking references not found? I can check my booking just fine on air Canada website so this app is not working. Update27.2.2020 - it's working again. Hopefully it still works after future updates.
14,Flight details and boarding pass at your fingertips..
15,This new updated app has wonderful user interface. Got huge dicounts. Thanks buddies.
16,Easy to use and understand
17,No hassle app. Very smooth going...
18,"Most convenient , fast and helpful"
19,"Still buggy.... unable to select meal preference (once selected in the app, the entire app shuts down), plus seating preference (window/aisle) has completely disappeared as an option from the updated app? Visually, much better looking though."
21,Can no longer store altitude card. Otherwise nice update.
22,"good, but it should be better to be downloaded in China's app store"
23,"So much happier with the new app. Haven't had time to really check the whole thing out, but had to provide some feedback."
24,Love this app! Gives you up to date status and provides everything you need at the touch of a button!
25,"Great flight tracking, schedules and app only features. Besides the usual schedules, alerts, booking, the are some nifty app only features like tracking the Inbound flight (know the chances of your flight getting delayed), view flight load and an offline boarding pass."
26,"Here is a feature request for the android smart watch (wear OS) version of the app. Please make the app force the display of the watch to stay on for at least 60 seconds when displaying the boarding pass. And also please display the boarding pass on first screen and allow to slide right to see fly detail. As the app is now, it's practically impossible to use as the watch always go back in ambient mode to soon. Best regards"
27,"After december 10th update, app will not load. I get an error message now and the app shuts down. nice. I really need this app to work for upcoming flights, this is very frustrating for me, and, I'm guessing many others. Update...the next Updatefixed the shutdown problem and the app runs much better...thank you for fixing! Bugs were fixed, for sure, no troubles for 6 months or more. Thank you, again for fixing!"
28,Great service always.
29,"I travel with Air Canada at least twice a month. About a year ago, this app was garbage. Now, it makes flying simpler. Period. If you fly Air Canada, use the app. 4 stars because room for improvement aesthetically and could use more seamless integration with tracking booked flights and calendar apps."
30,No idea why there aren't higher reviews for this app. Not a major fan of this airline but the app is so convenient that it actually names me want to fly more often with aircanada. Hoping this means improvements across the board for the whole company.
31,"Pleasent+easily read&understood app+helpful staffon ground+aboard. I enjoyed A C. this time around,and will reconmend it. No trouble on trip - I enjoyed these new airplanes>A320-200&B787-8Dreamliner-I did research on these planes.I was excited,and somewut impressed. Whitehorse-Montreal. Canadian Aboriginal Aids Network Conference-Aug 25-29,2019 recently."
32,good but i wish they improve the booking feature. i want something like cheapoair that shows live lowest fares when i hover each date in the calendar.
33,"Flawless, really. Added bonus to be able to track the inbound flight that will become your outbound flight!"
34,Always great service. Accomadating every time I fly with AC.
35,"works great, a lot of improvements and ease of operation"
36,It's fine but not the best and it would be great if you could save your boarding pass to Google pay
37,the app makes it easy to track flights.
38,Usually very easy to use and check in for all my flights
39,Very easy to use and a very well crafted design.
40,Excellent tool to stay on top of your flights
41,"easy to use, like boarding pass access"
42,Wonderful App. Everything at your fingertips
43,Very useful app to keep one informed of essential travel information
44,Great and Easy App to use!!!
45,Works well and simple to use.
46,The new app is more user friendly
47,This app works great for me.
48,great app. occasional glitches but not bad
49,Very good airline
50,Fast and accurate flight information
51,"april 1 update, fixed crash issue"
52,"Good app, info when you need it."
53,Very pleasant staff. landing were so smooth without drama
54,Great
55,"Surprisingly good app, very convenient."
56,Very useful and handy.
57,Very useful app
58,Good for in flight entertainment
59,Very Good app but need more updates
60,Does what it says
61,I feel it's next generation flight reservation app.
62,Works gud
63,Like having my flights at my finger tips
64,"This app did not work for me for i am not able to afford the cost of any tickets, as a black man. I have a son."
65,Great help for sublo staffs as well
66,Leo blamed me for this app's low rating. To counter his baseless accusations I'll rate it 5 stars.
67,Very User friendly
68,Was very happy and will use them again
69,works well with Samsung!
70,My dad made this app
71,great app no problema
72,Check-in from Florida to Canada App worked great. Was afraid to try after reading reviews.??.
73,One of the best airlines ever
74,Excellent went.I am travelling
75,User friendly App.
76,The new app is lit. Keep rocking
77,Â love Air Canada. Are good people and very professional
78,Does what I need.
79,"don't use it that much, no opinion."
80,Easy to use
81,Works well so far
82,It's awesome
83,new experience is painless
84,very good thank you air Canada
85,is very helfull
86,not Too bad
87,good app actually
88,working again.
89,Extremely accurate
90,Not bad..a little slow. Needs better functionality of the check-in... Should auto populate the reference number like the old app
91,Optimal
92,Amazing app
93,Fantastic
94,Fast 
95,love it!
96,Seems to keep getting better. Try it again if you had issues with a previous version. Pretty good now.
97,I dont know what everyone is talking about. I was also affected by the hack and I was able to change my password. At first it didnt work but you just have to be patient with the app. The company gets hacked and now everyone is there giving 1 star reviews as if that is going to fix the issues that you have with not knowing how to follow the instructions that they give you. Its 2018 hackers are out there and things like these happen regularly. The company does it's best to protect your information but mistakes happen. I am sure all of you have made mistakes at your workplace. At least the company saw the problem and acted on it RIGHT AWAY. Only about 1% of us was affected by this. (Probably more) but they acted so only a handful of people were affected. The app is a great tool for anyone flying with air Canada.
98,This app was so helpful. I didn't have to use a search engine. I got all my flight info at my finger tips.
99,"I love the app and have no problems, they had a crash for a day and went back working fine... I bought my ticket last year via the app and they kept me up to date with notifications and all about every change and detail about my flight, I just bought my ticket with them and everything seems to be fine... With all that said it's very convenient for me ??"
100,"I don't know why there are complaints. This app is slick. Provides clear status, seats, upgrade info, boarding cards. Great!"
101,"I use this app every 2 weeks to book my hubby's tickets for work. Been using it over a year and no issues at all. However, would like to see the option to add travel insurance."
102,Its been decent so far
103,Good app overall. Just don't use auto Updateon it. It will lose your boarding pass when an Updateis performed. This happened to me right before boarding last week.
104,"This app lets me track multiple trips, flights, and boarding passes. Updating flights in real time. I love it."
105,Air Canada actually replied to my original posting and told me that the app could do this if you linked the accounts. This was not obvious to me so there is a problem there but it did work after I looked into it. The app does retrieve my information now. Way better. Thanks for responding. When a person signs in it should pull up their flights not ask you to submit tracking numbers - useless app - perhaps the writers should try using it.
106,"Honestly, I do not understand the huge ranting going on about this app. It is working very well, tracking my future flights, having my Aeroplan synced, etc. The features are working as expected and information is provided as expected. I am just removing 1 star for excessive unnecessary visual information... It can be simpler and even more intuitive for its purpose."
107,"AC can you tell me why I can't log into my account via the app? Works fine without the app. When I try to log into the app it says my email and password isn't valid. What's the point of having an app for convenience when you can't even log in. This is infuriating. EDIT: Thanks AC, that fixed my problem. Works fine now. ??"
108,Would appreciate being able to provide feedback on particular flights through the application.
109,"This is a good app. Has some intelligent input features like auto-capping names and addresses. It's easy to book flights, to manage the bookings, and to check-in. It is easy to retrieve bookings and to view the boarding pass. This is one of the best flight apps I've seen."
110,Works like it should. I manage and book my flights including checkin and seat selection.
111,App was easy to use to check in. Used it to board the flight. App was timely of flight and gate changes. App still needs improvements to even stand with the other airlines such as Delta. They have checked luggage tracking where they notify you when your luggage is ready on the carousel.
112,"This app has come a long way since it was first introduced a few years ago. Those first few iterations were pretty useless. But now this is a very good app and I highly recommend it to Air Canada users. You can view your e-boarding pass, get flight status, and get notifications on flight status all from this well designed app. Kudos to Air Canada for keeping with this app and making improvements. Good job."
113,Works great for all the things it's supposed to. Checked in for all my flights and used the app to board my flights. Ability to make changes to a booking right from the app are great. Can a be a little slow to load sometimes when it's fetching fresh I formation. But overall very responsive and snappy.
114,"Great app, well setup making it much easier to track your upcoming flights, manage bookings, and makes it much easier to get from security to check-in to airborne."
115,Very slick and has everything I need to book and board a flight.
116,great app...0 issues since having this app....love it
117,It does everything I want an airline app to do. It's intuitive and easy enough to use.
118,"Great app if you fly allot. I feel sorry for all the complainers on Google Play reviews. My answer to them, "" aw, muffins"""
119,I booked my flight and preregistered for my flight with this app no problem at all. Also have very easy access to my boarding pass.
120,"Smooth app, however, when viewing booked flights, flight duration doesn't take time zone changes in to consideration."
121,Recent updates are a significant improvement
122,Well this app is nice but it can get really annoying and it takes a long Time to find the good movies and I am 11 years old and I like horror Movies so add horror movies and I will delete my comment and rate It 5 stars.
123,Excellent work! Love the standby and import booking features!
124,"Saying network not available... while I have full WiFi signals Edit: got replied, thanks. It's issue with Android system webview. Why not to include such helpful information in the error message? At least I can try this app now. So increased to 3 stars. Edit2: I was not able to notice any important note on somewhere top during the frustration... Please show/pop it when users need it, such as in the error message, rather than let us check the network... misleadingly. But one more star for the CS."
125,"Just moved from BB OS10 to Android. The bb10 version was a ported Android App but was a bit more stable and connection was much faster. As for the app itself, it is very convenient for the frequent flyer. Love the standby and upgrade list function. Ability to book flights is straightforward."
126,I used this app and worked great and would have given it a 5 star until I upgraded it recently. Lost all my flight information and reservations and cannot retrieve this important information for my return home. I deleted the app and reinstalled it with no success. This leaves me stuck as can't use telephone for air Canada and they have no email to confirm flight information. This is very upsetting to say the least. Richard
127,"Horrible. I tracked a flight from last Saturday, and because they use the same flight number regularly, I am now getting notices about this week's flight. No way to delete it, or another flight number that I entered incorrectly. Had to uninstall and reinstall (because that's the only way you can track their flights). Total garbage."
128,This is the worst app I've ever used. It won't let me add boarding passes for an existing reservation and checked in for. It would not let me finish the check in process and I had to use the website on a laptop instead. What's the point of offering the app if it's useless?
129,"This app sucks so bad that you should consider using west jet. Every second booking the check in is not working, not on the cell phone or i pad. I will consider not flying air canada anymore because of there failing app. Convinence out the window back to old style check in."
130,Honestly if I can give this app a zero I would. Nothing but frustration with Air Canada and Aeroplan credentials. I travel often with many airlines and this app has to be the worst. The user interface absolutely useless. So frustrating.
131,Worked well until november changeover in software - never works now - need name and booking reference number to do anything - why cant they use flight number or aeroplan number as well - who carries their booking refernce number? Useless app now.
132,"This app NEVER works. All you get is ""sorry an error has occurred. We hope to resolve this issue soon. You can't download your boarding pass or check your flight status"
133,"Tapping ""continue"" button twice causes failure. I was unable to check-in using app. After I checked-in at air Canada web page I cannot add boarding passes to the app."
134,You went from being a useable app which allowed you to basically check everything about your flight to basically a bloated app that points to your website. Worst is you are forced to Updatethe app!
135,Doesn't work. Keeps giving me an error message every time I look up my flight. I have installed and re-installed several times to no avail.
136,What a garbage app. Doesn't Updateany information (Gate.. seat ) and it keeps giving me an error when adding the boarding pass. Such an embarrassment
137,"Like the other reviewers, the app is very difficult as every step taken results in a message informing me that the session is no longer available. Check-in online is easier but another barrier is the app is not compatible on any Samsung device (not available for download to our Samsung tablets from Google Play). This is not good if you have kids!!!!"
138,"Your app is as bad as your customer service. Absolutely garbage. Will not get another dollar from me after throwing up error codes, and TRIPLE CHARGING ME for a single ticket. And not even giving it to me. Then sitting on hold for 3 HOURS, WHILE OFFERING ""GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE"" figure it out"
139,"Has some good features. Tends to crash. The low rating is from the crash that occurred at the critical moment of check in whilst sitting in a remote, non-english speaking, foreign (from our perspective) country."
140,"Sadly this app is close to useless. Air Canada used to provide information such as what gate your flight is at, but now nothing that is not on your original ticket, keeps prompting to check-in for flight, but I have."
141,Liked the old version. New one can't find my flights to check in most of the time and when it does usually says it failed check-in but seems to have worked anyways. Need to have standby / upgrade and track inbound all linked to boarding pass instead of having to go through multiple menus each time to look
142,"I am now in Dutch Carribean and AC website wouldn't let me check flight status for my outbound flight! As soon as I get to AC website, I get a pop-up blocking the screen that travellers from this country have to contact AC reservation... What about Canadians who are here on vacation and what flight status has to do with reservations? Whoever designed this website is an idiot! The Android app is no better, as soon as I start the app it forces me to upgrade and doesn't let me use existing version."
143,"Constantly issues. Mobile checkin doesnt work, always crashes, in flight demands doesnt load and recommend to change plugin mid-flight which cant happen. No advance seat selection can be made or eupgrades. The only good thing are the email and mobile nofitications"
144,"Downloaded this to check in, only to discover it times out on every attempt! Going to check in using an internet browser instead. Keeping this useless app just in case it notifies me of delays or cancellations (doubtful: won't even let me check in)"
145,Cannot get this stupid thing to work right. It keeps apologizing for errors but doesn't fix them
146,Previous app had calendar integration but this version does not which kind of defeats the purpose of having this app.
147,Like the new interface however it keeps crashing on my S10+ with Android 10. Only uninstall + reinstall fixes it.
148,"Doesn't show you what terminal you are supposed to go to in the Trips section of the app, you have to go to the boarding pass section and it's annoying af"
149,Barely passable as an app. Almost no functionality.
150,Looks alright but there is pertinent information that is no longer available. Digital altitude card doesn't seem to be an option anymore and when you click on your flight if it's going through the states used to inform you if you needed to clear customs. I'm currently going to Vancouver then Las Vegas from Calgary. No idea anymore where I'm going to customs.
151,"There are a few things you'd like expect this app to do well 1) Get to your boarding pass....Nope. most of the time I need to click more, boarding passes, then select the correct one (it shows all old ones). There is no easy notification direct to the boarding pass 2) Show your AC status....nope. Nowhere to be found. This caused me an issue when asking a lounge to print me a new boarding pass. They wouldn't without seeing my status... 3) Check in...nope. Most of the time it's missing"
152,"The app has taken an enormous step backwards in terms of functionally, design, and performance. Why cannot I edit the features of my flight booked through air canada? Why are boarding passes no longer automatically generated? Why is my name misspelled in the app? On Galaxy S10+ the scrolling animations stutter , menus lag ,and the general aesthetic of the app is visually unappealing. How can this be possible? What exactly was wrong with the previous app? This app feels and runs like its 2009."
153,"How do you check-in!? Without going to the more options section? It's under the My Flights section, but if you stop checking in and try again later it doesn't show the option to check-in. How useless! Also it doesn't store CC data for faster checkout when booking a flight. I'd like to see that feature brought back so I don't have to have my card with me when booking a flight. Overall nice looking app, not great function."
154,"New app. New teething problems. Want to add your boarding pass? It's hidden in the more section. Which btw does not work today. Hopefully soon? App says my phone number country code is wrong and go into the web to fix it. Except it's fine and in the profile. Clearly QA failed to check data parsing. The previous app was great by comparison. AC, you need to test and beta your code more before throwing it over the wall and on your customers heads."
155,"What happened to the app? It feels as though half the functionality has been stripped out - I can log in to my Aeroplan but other than setting my personal information, what is the point of this?"
156,Won't show arrival terminal nor seats assigned which is fairly useless.
157,"Was able to find my itinerary. After opening the app though it forgot everything and now it can't be found again. Tried signing up through AeroPlan hoping to add it online - very slow process, up to 30 minutes for a verification code?! And wasn't able to find the flight info anyways. Don't understand the value of any of these tools."
158,"App was ok till the last update. Unable to sign in so does not allow to link flights booked. Unable to add altitude card details so boarding passes do not carry Altitude Status .. UX is going down .. Edit 1 - The new app sucks at levels new even for Air Canada. The QA should really should ask for money back from his/her school. Cannot check in, cannot import boarding pass if checked in online, no connectivity to Altitude Plan. Please plant a few trees every week for use of paper boarding passes."
159,"The new interface is terrible. It has forgotten all of my information, doesn't automatically pull my bookings, etc. So far I've been unable to check in for my flights since the app was changed and have to check in on the web from my desktop or at the airport."
160,"Notably less useful than other airline apps. App required me to input record numbers for check-in and for boarding pass even though I was logged in and it should know what flights I have. Also, the check-in process failed repeatedly. Dev team needs to focus more on UX."
161,"The new Air Canada app loses most of the features of the app it replaced. The only saving grace at the moment is the app responds much faster now, probably due to better coding and integration with the new reservation system. When all the features return it will be better."
162,Check in is not working on the app since the last update. AC staff at airport counters have mention many traveler have the same experience.
163,"Just go to the mobile website, this app sucks. Wont let you check in, boarding passes work once in a while. It's just a slow goofy, semi functioning app. If they made some tweaks and things worked properly, it would be a great app"
164,"Many options on the app, unfortunetly none is working. Always receive a message : ""sorry it's embarassing but this option don't work"". Well at least you try but next time try to put more effort in the funtionality and less in emoji in your error message"
165,"The new app seems to constantly lose my boarding pass for return legs. Whenever on a trip, I can only ever get access to my outbound boarding pass even though it may be from several days in the past."
166,Horrible app since update....cant enter my aeroplan number. Every time i try to enter the number it logs me out instantly telling me to log back in and it does the same thing over and over again.
167,"Useless app. If you want to do more than just view your itinerary and have an electronic boarding pass, forget it, just use their website and save yourself your storage space."
168,Updating to the newest version wiped out all of the flight info I had saved in the previous version. I had to find all the reservation numbers and reload them all in the updated app.
169,"6 month ago I gave a 1 to AC app, it was a mess.... Now it's getting better and better and I use it daily without any problem. Still slow and the waiting should be manage better. Next step the visual which is minimal. Keep it up"
170,"The flow is completely wrong and unintuitive. Check-in and boarding passes under ""More"", Really? Notifications now limited to one option. All or nothing choice. And calendar integration, disapeared? Or just just hidden many layers down in a menu item. UPDATED to 3 starts from 1 because of improvements described below. Calendar synch is half there hidden a few layers down but has to be trigged manually for each trips. Still not intuitive."
171,Their User interface is not the best but it works... Most of the time. Just to be safe always print your boarding pass. Also screen capture you boarding pass. They should explain it abit better. The app is tied to your account. Both have to match in order for it to work well. The app works but it is not very intuitive.
172,Pretty good app but I find it ridiculous that it orders boarding passes with the oldest on top. I have to scroll through many old boarding passes to get to the one I need
173,"Would think that you can add Star Alliance loyalty program number, not everyone wants Aeroplan points..... Also can't add reservations ... Need to fix this."
174,UPDATED: March 17th. Finally can add existing reservations. Let's give it a month and see if it gets more than 3 stars.
175,"Is there any way I can select the seat from the app before check-in? The seat selection feature was there in old app version, but I cant find it in the new app version."
176,"Over all good but, could be better for sure.."
177,I was surprised to see that there was no biometric authentication option in this new update(Nov 2019). I wish they bring it back! Should have more than just three airport maps or atleast list all the lounges and AC facilities around the globe with an option to purchase one-time passes in the app. Integration with Google services like Google Pay to store the boarding passes and Calendar sync for trips. The developer should also consider combining the Rouge Player app with this one.
178,"The new app is not pleasing, I was asked to be a participant in the beta but the download never worked in the first place. The old app was great either but I'm hoping that there is some upgrades in the future. Integration with altitude is Zero it seems. Not sure what the big plan is for the future but I hope we step it up a bit."
179,"App requires start through the Google Play only. No indcation of altitude status. It would be helpf to have status indication instaed having plastic card. - helpful to have indication of gate for boarding; luggage carousel when arrived. - also would be cool to have boarding started notification and also an option to identify yourself (fot example when boarding already started, but you still have distance to walk to the gate...) - Indication of check-in/luggage drop-off counters would be useful."
180,Missing the time until next flight (hour and minutes) on the new app.. the old one had it and it was great when you had delays and tight connections. This information should be located on the first tab when the app is open. Please add this feature back
181,"sorta ok but some procedures aren't intuitive. looks like programmers never 'test drove' this thing. and AC is VERY slow in announcing flight delays & cancellations,lll & equipment & gate changes. WITH DUMB NOV 2019 APP UpdateCAN ONLY SEARCH FLIGHTS UP TO THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE!!!!"
182,This new Updatekeeps crashing. Really great news for me as I have a flight in 6 hours and can't retrieve my boarding pass. Well done AC.
183,"Latest version of the app (v 5.0.1, 2019-11-15) force closes immediately after opening app. App is currently unusable. Using a Pixel 2XL on Android 10. Please fix the app."
184,"The new app looks like a great improvement, all except one huge issue. It does not bring over previously saved trips. Huge annoyance, that is a easy fix for the developers."
185,This version of the app seems to be a shell of it's former self. It works maybe 1/2 of the time.
186,App is negligible in quality since update. Used to show gate and relevant info but not anymore. Please consider a valuable Updatethat is beneficial to the user community
187,There are continued bugs with partner elite status not being recognised and seat assignment issues.
188,Not saving trip bookings have to re-add every time i assume it will impact flight notifications
189,It should not take 3 taps to get your boarding pass.
190,It still does not look finnished. It has no flow to it
191,"So the new Updatenow deletes my address and credit card number every time. Huge pain. Please fix. Really big fan of bringing the calendar sync option back. Thank you. That really helps with my planning for conference call and also looking back to see which cities I was in on which days. Love to see the calendar info include a little more information like the terminal number, maybe the comments could show the recommended check in times. Good progress."
192,The old app was better and had better functionality
193,"I use this regularly to show my boarding pass, but this app is very unstable. The looks have improved a lot through the ages, but not performance."
194,"Not sure what has changed recently, but this app no longer sends digital boarding cards via text or notifications. Also what really has me disappointed is the Air Canada app for android wear os no longer works and has disappeared off the Google Play Store. The wear os app was extremely helpful with the availability of having my boarding pass on my watch, notifications of flight changes and count down to boarding displayed along with gate number. It's all gone. Please make this available once again as it was such a great traveling tool, especially for people like myself that travel very often. Please make compatiable with Fossil Q Explorist again"
195,"the app will say it has no connection if it is sent to the background and brought back again. as far as Air Canada is concerned, i will not be flying with them again. on international flights they make you pay for your luggage. if you have a long layover, they make you get your luggage and re check it and make you pay another fee. so for 2 suitcases it cost me 240 dollars each way. 120 each time we had to check in our luggage. i will stick with air new zealand."
196,"While waiting as a restuarant for my order, I had to change my Air Canada account password to confirm my booking, so when I changed it, it brought me back to the original booking for me to confirm. When I confirmed the booking, I choose my seat on the flight and only then had I realized that changing my password had brought me to two different bookings for the exact same flight and date had been both confirmed. I was left with $9 on my bank card and was humiliated trying to explain to the waitress at the restuarant that I couldn't pay for my lunch because this app had double booked and double charged me after simply changing my password. Please fix the app so the same humiliation doesn't happen to anybody else? Still waiting for my refund to go on my bank card..."
197,"I'm having issues recently. The error I get is the app doesn't connect to a network whether it's wifi or phone network. Tried installing the app multiple times, same problem. Cannot connect to network. Please help."
198,Some things work well. But the chekin process is full of bugs. Seats won't carry to flight. Group notification will ONLY take the first person. Changing a person checkin will auto assign individual notification using another peraon's email. And I'm just getting started. A little QA wouldn't hurt.
199,I am disappointed with this app! good thing i had screenshot my boarding pass. Went to the airport and went to the original gate only to find out that they have switched to another gate. I could not get this new information because every time i click to view boarding pass app crashes.
399,"It is not user friendly. It doesn't go to the next screen properly & sometimes makes using it a challenge. I have tried to make a reservation several times but when I select a flight, it takes me to another screen & wants me to upgrade. I can't get out of that upgrade screen to move forward. Ergo, I may have to switch airlines to book my trip.."
401,I think Delta has a great app. Thanks Delta!
402,Garbage - keeps losing my trips when I'm logged in
403,The app should display your upcoming flight details. Other airlines show your bookings in the app. This app requires you to enter the booking reference first to find your booking which means you have to store that info elsewhere. Should be a one stop shop for your Delta flight.
404,I have yet to remember an app that would be so confusing to use
405,Ease and dependable
406,Bad last version. Use the App for many years and always worked great. Now it's not showing my tickets anymore. I checked in on the website and the app keeps asking for a check in. When you go through that it gives an error message at the end...and still no ticket. Horrible
407,Checking in and getting boarding passes went well but the app gave me several incorrect flight updates and sent me to the wrong baggage carousel. It consistently wouldn't recognize my e-mail as valid despite sending me emails to that address.
408,I can't download it My phone has a time out. I would have to sit and click download all day. It's saying 3. I would give it a 1. Love the airline. Hate the app.
409,"I always fly Delta, and their app makes flying with them even easier! I'm typing this sitting on my plane right now. I was lucky to actually make it on, Delta's app updated me constantly on what was going on with my flights so I was able to go straight from my VERY delayed flight to my next flight without having to stop at the board. Saving me that time allowed me to make it to the last of the boarding and I'm able to get to my destination on time. The app also updated me on my luggage so I know it's here with me on the plane and not going to some other destination or lost in transit. It has the digital boarding pass as well so you don't have to worry about losing it in the airport, I personally always print out my boarding pass as well (mostly as travel keepsakes). If you fly with Delta it really pays to have the app. It just makes your whole trip so much smoother."
410,"Generally a decent app for going paperless which is nice. However, not a single time I have attempt to purchase a mile booster or make any purchases of any kind through the app have I been able to complete the purchase. I'm always faced with a service is unavailable type prompt and because of this Delta has missed out on much of my money, Lol. I will never make the extra effort to use a computer to complete this or purchase anything in person. As a pretty stereo typical millennial, I can tell you that you are missing out on a lot of money Delta by not having a working app. You do some much else so well but this is for sure an important piece of the puzzle. Figure it out please."
411,"This app is far and away the best airline app out there. When my flight was delayed, the app immediately offered to switch me to an earlier flight and offered four suggestions. The service was immediate, and far exceeded anything I could have gotten at the gate or the check-in counter. Delta has also really streamlined the check-in process for the app. All I have to do is acknowledge that I can't bring dangerous materials. Where other airlines use the check-in process to try and sell you upgrades, Delta has simply streamlined theres for efficiency. I'm consistently impressed by this application."
412,"App continually crashes. More often than not, I can't even make a reservation. My reservation has been lost along with my boarding pass at the most inconvenient times. Better get a hard copy of your boarding pass because you can't depend on the app having it."
413,Love delta best airline!
414,"We all need one primary thing from an airline app, and that's our boarding pass. This is not immediately nor really available from the app. It was easier to use their clunky website and get my boarding passes texts to my phone. I've never uninstalled an app so fast, never found an app so useless. It looks like it's loaded with features, yet nothing I need is contained within."
415,"The app is a bit frustrating really. On my phone the dialogue boxes don't line up in the frame, so you can't select anything, I have to go in as a guest, because it doesn't accept my account information, and when I do things like reset my password, the app says that the functionality is unavailable and to try again later. Dissappointed. Apps like this can be a great help when traveling, and just make things so much more simple. Hoping these get fixed."
416,"I've used this app for years, and it's always been great. Now, with my. latest trip it was showing my flight as being 'Today' even though it wasn't for 24 hours, and when I approached the gate to enter, the boarding pass disappeared. Not cool. It seems to have some issue with the Time Zone perhaps? Never had an issue until now. But, I could see how it could be a major issue if you are just entering security when it goes away -- luckily for. me I just had the gate agent print a boarding pass for me. Fix this!"
417,"Boarding passes for the right flight automatically showed as if I was flying a day early. Then, on the right day I had to search to find the boarding pass. It found it and I was able to use it to get through security. Then, literally while three steps from the gate the pass disappeared and told me I had no flights that day. Time to uninstall and find an airline that can manage their app."
418,Cool idea but execution is bad. It keeps losing by boarding passes.
419,"Terrible. half the time when you open the app to view your trip information, it doesn't pull it up. Rather, it asks for your flight number and confirmation. While you are already logged in... Why do they think I got this app? So i have that information handy! I can't tell you how many times i have stood in line to board, only to get to the front and need 5 minutes to look up my information. separately."
420,"Awful. Love the layout and the look, but it often crashes and/or just doesn't work. Trying to change my seat from the boarding pass screen ALWAYS crashes. Doing it from my trips usually works, but overall its no longer dependable even for a boarding pass. Too often, I've gotten into the boarding area (SKY btw) and the boarding pass disappears and i have to step aside and wait until the gate agent can manually check me in. By then they've boarded the whole plane, it's just ridiculous."
421,"Oooweee, I'm a bit new to Delta and this is my first time using the app. It is some hot garbage. Can't just view my trip without inputting conf#, try to check in but get the ""one of the legs of your trip requires a gate agent"" but it keeps kicking me back, so no mobile boarding pass. Gate changed and 20 min later we're still waiting to take off; no updates on either from the app. But I can ""track"" my bag! ?? What a turd."
422,"The phone app is great, the WearOS app not so much. The WearOS app will stay on and not show the boarding pass well (white screen most of the time and not the QR boarding pass code). Also, with the new WearOS 2.0 upgrade, this app caused the watch to constantly crash this morning every 30-45 seconds. Uninstalling the watch app brought stability back to the watch."
423,"Okay help tool, don't depend on it. While I was flying, Delta sput me out on my transfer airport with 10 minutes until boarding at the opposite side of the airport and I still had to go through passport check. I know that is not the fault of the app, but it certainly didn't make it any easier that I had to hunt down an airport employee, that didn't send me away because of my young age, to ""discover"" what my boarding gate is, since the app didn't display it. It also ""forgot"" my flights..."
424,"Undo your changes! When my screen times out i have to relaunch the app. This is a huge inconvenience when boarding, going through security or even searching fights. This a relatively recent change that is a big pain. If I have the boarding pass up and the screen times out I should not have to go back to the beginning to relaunch the app and then wait for the QR code to pop up just to go through secure or boarding. Please go back to prior functionality that leaves you where you left off."
425,App requires a good deal more attention in order to make it functional. App regularly requires me to re-check in in order to access my boarding pass which has caused numerous frustrations while boarding in airports with poor connectivity. This is a major bug that needs to be addressed.
426,Awesome service great flights
427,"I rated the app one star for one reason. It doesn't save my boarding pass. It says i don't have any current trips and I have to search for it via my name and confirmation number every time I open the app. This is a huge pain while traveling in the airport because I have to keep pulling it up. The boarding pass and trip is such a basic thing it should not disappear from the app. Honestly, it created such an issue while going through security that I don't think I'll be flying Delta anymore."
428,The app hasn't been reliable for at least 3 months. You have to have paper boarding passes as a backup. I have been at the gate on a connecting flight and your boarding pass disappears. It says that you have no flights scheduled. Then you are holding up the line. It is very frustrating. I have reported the problems to counter personnel and gate personnel. Very unreliable.
429,"App never allowed me check-in; always had to use a laptop or desktop. App ""needs"" access to GPS location for some reason but couldn't possibly rely on phone's provider for datetime. My phone's datetime updates automatically by signals in time zones without having to enable GPS. App is seems slower now (June 2019) than in March of 2018. App runs even when I have no flights; unable to disable; removing until I need to fly again."
430,Site way complicated to navigate. Takes you all over but not where you wont. Needs to be way more of a simple design lay out
431,"The app works only under ideal circumstances. Today I was flying on an itinerary with 2 tickets under different names. The boarding pass barcodes were reversed - not matching with the names and seat assignments displayed above them. This caused a big mess at security and the gate. Since it isn't possible to verify the barcode myself, this is something Delta should make sure works. (Also, the app doesn't let you send the SMS boarding pass that works correctly - you have to use the website.)"
432,"Fly American often, but lately have had a few Delta flights. they're both the two largest American airlines and I expected the apps to be similar. Wrong. The Delta app behaves in complely unexpected ways. It suddenly needs to refresh when you just looked at your boarding pass a minute ago but now you're showing it to the agent before entering the line, causing other passengers behind you to look at you in disgust. This is just one example."
433,"the app constantly reloads your check in every time you open or toggle to the app, fails as you likely won't have service at the terminal door. it'd be helpful to add the option to save boarding pass to a mobile wallet. the application will also auto check in when you open it the night before the flight, bypassing the option to change seats or request a comfort+ seat. once you're checkd in trying to change seats results in an error. they will tell u to call 800# to waste time, no fix in sight"
434,"Overall the user experience is fine, however I have had a number of issues where a trip will suddenly disappear. I've been sitting at the gate, go to pull up my boarding pass and it's gone. Leaving me to scramble for my confirmation number to re-add the trip. My next trip, I'll be getting a printed boarding pass."
435,"This app is useless as a boarding pass. I've tried to use it twice, and both times it would repeatedly log out before boarding. lt'd force me to re-enter my name and confirmation number almost every time tried to use it, even if I hadn't closed the app or locked my phone. This last time I managed to get through security using it, but when I got to the gate, the app forgot me again and said it couldn't be used for my flight! They had to print me a boarding pass there at the gate. 100% useless."
436,Awful experience. Poorly designed UI. Slow responses. Crashes. Paper tickets were a much better customer experience. Delta should be ashamed to subject their customers to this app.
437,It's too flakey always having difficulty
438,Works intermittently at best. Delta's website is not much better.
439,This app is incredibly slow on my phone and flaky. I have to delete it and reinstall it quite a bit.
440,"The app works great when you're not in the airport, however when you're in the airport it fails. It either takes several minutes to load your boarding pass, or it gives up entirely. I'm at FLL now and had to get printed tickets from the gate when the app lost all of my information and stopped logging in, after spending several minutes at the TSA station waiting for the boarding passes to load, even though I had them preloaded already and waiting to go. Screenshots are the way to go."
441,"Bag tracker doesn't show which carousel, the airport monitors have the information but not the app. Inbound flight selection rarely works on the first attempt, must reload page then try again. App wastes 5 seconds every time it starts, just to show the Delta logo. Early and late flights looks the same with a big red exclamation point. Clicking on notifications doesn't take you to the associated page and notification disappears."
442,"I use this app pretty often as I travel about 1.5 times a month on average, most of the domestic trips on Delta. The bar was pretty low for airline apps but I'm always so impressed with how good this app is. I can do everything I need to on the app and have all the info easily at my fingertips. Searching for flights is easy, changing flights or cancelling flights is easy. I love that the boarding pass is clear, easy to use, helps save paper, updates pretty instantly with any new info, and has all necessary links like clicking on your seat takes you to the seat selection screen."
443,Very powerful and useful app but calendar is so frustrating!!! Add to calendar feature is suboptimal. When an itinerary consists of two connecting flights it only adds the first leg. Even on the apple version the total span of time is added for both flights (I still have to hard code type the 2nd flight number) but not so on Android version.
444,"Platinum member. The App has some nice features, but utterly lacks a good user endgame. It reels with a corporate ""you come to me"" feel. Why do I have to check in 10 times for a simple flight to get to my boarding pass? Why do I have to start over every time I launch the App while waiting at my gate? Get it right Delta. You have billions of dollars. A proper App is a small thing in the scheme of things. You have a 3.5 star rating for this App, and that is generous. Deliver."
445,I don't know what's happened to this app but none of my reservations pull through anymore. It used to work so much more smoothly in the past...fix the dang issues Delta
446,"This last trip had a delay due to weather. The app told me that it was running late and suggested that I get a different connecting flight. It was so helpful and that new flight was at no charge (maybe because I had the insurance?) The reason for the 4 stars is that, while it was usually great at remembering my info even though I was signed in as a guest, it would forget in the worst timing: when I was in line to board the plane and needed to show my e-boarding pass. I would recommend it anyway."
447,The app doesn't let me even sign in.
448,"My Trips was the most useful part of this app. now it's just a marketing tool to up sale customers. no focus on usability for the actual guest. i loved using it to simply validate that my flight and seat assignments are correct and give me a feeling of confidence that delta didn't muck with my original purchase months ago. it shows two radio buttons, a dollar amount or sky miles, and a button that says, select or purchase seat assignment. what a confusing mess! sales dept has ruined the app!"
449,This is the absolute worst airline app. I travel weekly and it is completely unreliable. The moment you lose wifi or data your boarding pass disappears and the app says you do not have any trips. This is ridiculous - other airline apps keep your boarding pass available at all times. I am Platinum on Delta and the app is so frustrating that I am considering going back to United. Fix this!!!
450,"Most common issue I see among user reviews, & applies to me as well -- trips that I have previously entered do not get saved when I return to view later. The website seems to have this same issue. This makes it so the user must enter their first/last name & confirmation code every time they want to view trips which is very inconvenient. Accessing the boarding pass quickly is the only reason I have for downloading airline apps in the first place. This should be a high priority bug. Phone: Pixel 3"
451,"I would give it three stars if this was only for domestic flights. I tried this for my family's trip from a US city to Cancun. The check-in worked fine though I had to enter passport information for myself, my wife and son. But several significant problems happened after that. 1. The app does not provide an offline mode. When we arrived at Cancun, and went through the custom and security, I was asked to show boarding passes. At that time. my cell phone was not connected to the network via WiFi. When I opened the app, it tried to Updatethe information and said something like ""need to be connected to network"". I couldn't find a way to show e-boarding passes. 2. There is no way to show e-boarding passes after the flight has arrived at the destination. So, in my case, I guess I couldn't have shown the e-boarding passes at the security anyway even if the app was connected to the network. 3. For our return flight, I tried to check in at the hotel. But the app didn't allow me to do so. It only worked for my son because he is a US citizen. My wife and I had to check in at the airport. So, it is useless for international flights."
452,"don't use for bag check. error when adding bag w/app. added bags to all 6 in party in not just 1 person checking bag. couldn't pay or correct error in app. CS agent kept talking over me when trying to explain problem, ten min in call FINALLY asked for confirm. # to check prob. couldn't correct either and said to just check @ airport but we were staying @ Disney resort so bag transfers from resort must be paid in advance & are printed on boarding pass. very frustrating!"
453,I recently flew and forgot my Delta Credit card and couldn't make purchases on my flight. I'd like to see added to the app a QR code in the app linking the credit card so the flight attendant can scan the QR code charging to my credit card. This will also save the flight attendant time as they will no longer have to input an email address to send a receipt. What do you think?
454,"The app doesn't work at all. Had to print my boarding passes anyway because the stupid app wouldn't pull it up. Also as a side note. Delta has been a horrible experience and after this trip, I will never fly Delta again. Delta has forever lost my business. I will be deleting this app. You guys are horrible all around and the app is a reflection of this."
455,I have spent over an hour trying to book flights for myself and a friend and I have never had so many problems with anything! First of all I can't book through the app because I'm using gift cards and there is absolutely no place to use them on the app which is absolutely ridiculous. And then I had issues trying to do it online! I thought apps were supposed to make things easier not harder
456,"needs to be cleaned up. too many tabs. needs a widget like the other 2 major carriers. the app loses my record and have to type first and last name everytime looking for my record(should know my name from my acount that im logged into). just doesnt look clean and sharp and bright like other airline apps. colors are dark and bland. give options like ""find skyclub"" or ""why is my flight delayed?"""
457,"The app is consistently spotty. ""We're sorry but we cannot locate your flight at this time"" or ""we're sorry but we cannot complete your request at this time"" etc. Unfortunately these issues occur when the app is most needed, check in, boarding, or at times when the app is needed for updates during times of flight issues. The app should save time and stress for the customer throughout the entire travel experience, but it has consistently (in the last 7 months) failed to do this."
458,Fails to Updateflight info such as gate# and departure time even though all the info at 24 hr prior check-in and info at airport arrival is up to date. The app's flight departure time and gate info doesn't get accurate info until the plane that you're leaving on has actually landed at your airport. Just print boarding pass on a PC and do it the old way. At least you'll have the info. App also feezes and needs to be restarted.
459,"1. entered valid credit card several times and it gave fatal error and required that I start over repeatedly. 2. why cant I shop for flights and switch between credit card and miles at the end?? 3. why dont you store my delta credit card that I've used dozens of times on your app? I always click save for later when available. 4. all fields required error... but I filled in all fields. 5. app wont keep me signed in no matter how many times I try to save credentials.... Delta, get it together."
460,"A silly app if you're flying codeshare. I flew with a Delta ticket on Aeromexico. I checked in on the app but had to check in again at the airport with Aeromexico to get a boarding pass. The Delta app offered no information on gate number, departure time, baggage - nothing. It was absolutely without value apart from making me believe, initially, that I was checked in."
461,"This app was great until this morning when I was getting ready to go through airport security. I had it up on my phone and when I pulled it up, the app said it was temporarily unavailable. I couldn't get it to work that I had to go back to the ticket counter and have them print them off! I had almost missed my flight. So disappointing."
462,"I mean, it does the job... sometimes. For a nationwide/international company, this app is pretty sub-par. It frequently logs you out, using a password manager seems to not allow you to log in, seat map and selection screens don't work all the time, and it generally feels sluggish. Pared with the awkward feel of the user experience and it leaves you with a bad taste in the mouth before you even get to the airport. It's a shame, really. Especially when United's app does the same but *much* better."
463,Keeps crashing...did a re-install. Still crashing. I only fly Delta. Not very useful if I can't use it.
464,"Good app, does what I want when I need it"
465,"I just returned from a trip. I flew on 4/17 and 4/24. I managed 4 boarding passes with TSA on the phone. on 4/17, just as we were about to board, the boarding passes completely disappeared from the app. just not there. caused a delay, had to provide my license, they had to print 4 boarding passes. I chalked it up to a glitch. A week later it was time to board 4 people again. I loaded the app before security and the boarding passes were there. I hung out at the airport for an hour before boarding and they ere there. I was checking all of the time because of the previous experience, but was confident it was a glitch. Guess what, right as my zone MAIN1 was boarding again, they disappeared. Nothing I tried to do worked. I logged out and back in, i tried to search for boarding passes via confirmation, i even restarted my phone and they were GONE!!!! How frustrating! what's the point? Luckily, i used the screenshots this time, but the bottom line is THE APP CAN'T BE TRUSTED. Don't even get me started on the old broken down plane I flew on."
466,"nothing like getting to the front if the security line for a flight you are already late for, and your boarding pass disappearing from your screen as you're about to scan it. got a message saying no travel plans found for traveler. had to run out grab a pass from a kiosk, wait in line again and barely made my flight. this app is extremely unreliable. also cant do same day flight changes from app."
467,"The Fly Delta app is beneficial to every type of traveler. As a leisure-traveler and Medallion member, the Fly Delta app provides updated on the go information that's relevant to what I'm doing. Bag tracking, boarding passes, seat maps, and flight status are all accessible within seconds. Mobile check-in is seamless. Flight updates and alerts such as time changes, gate changes, boarding starting, and cancellations are delivered instantly."
468,Love the app hate the bugs. its essentially a great app but when switching from cellular to wifi or just the opposite and the app is open it wipes out all of your saved trips. if you use the back button or force close app it also erases. seems to only be an android issue. it's extremely frustrating when you are in line with TSA qnd you lose your boarding pass
469,"the app constantly boots you so you have to log in every time you use it. It also frequently rejects correct log in information - i couldn't log in with a password i had written down the last time i changed it, then was forced to change my password, which was then also rejected flying is stressful enough without being locked out of your account before your flight every time"
470,"For at least 4 months this app has not allowed me to book travel through it and won't remember my Delta Amex info. I haven't written review because Delta's usually on top of things, but this is rediculous. I go through all steps of the purchase until where i enter new credit card and click the Buy button. It tells me I need to fill in all fields to continue and vacates what I've put in the security code field. I then re-type my security code and it does it again, always deleting what I've typed."
471,"I use this app every time I fly. about 4-6 times a month. It's very good WHEN IT WORKS. If there is any sort of flight delay the app becomes completely useless. 9 times out of 10 it doesn't Updateto your latest flight if they rebook missed conmections. I also travel with a dog, when you do that the airline doesn't let you check in on the app, which is fine. But once I check in at the airline the app should start working as normal, But it Doesn't! It also has constant errors when picking seats."
472,"It will often drop my reservation. When I reenter the flight confirmation number and name it just spits out the error ""We were unable to find a reservation with the information provided. Please try again"" Yet if I go to the Delta website no problems finding my reservation. This crash usually occurs when the flight gets delayed or when you're trying to pull up a boarding pass to get on the plane"
473,Can't get in. Can't reset login
474,Very good airline App
475,"app did not Updatemy connecting flight information (gate, boarding time), even though the gate was listed 24 hours ago when I printed my boarding pass. choose the track my bags button and I was required to put on my bag numbers - I did not have to do this with the United app. the app does not give the information about the flight (power, wifi, food, etc)"
476,"Consistently, by the time I reach my first stop, all electronic boarding passes are gone - even the one I used on my first flight. Ticket counter and gate personnel are aware of this flaw. Hopefully you are too. Please fix."
477,"It's very inconvenient to use. This app can't remember my name and any flight confirmation number. I have to go through a cumbersome login procedure every time I reopen the app to access my boarding pass. In the end, I had to use the Delta website to print my boarding pass to a PDF file on my phone."
478,"this app is buggy and unreliable 1. Even if ive pre-loaded my boarding pass when i have access to data, when i get to the gate, about half the time the app relaunches and makes me log in again and enter the flight number. 2. When flying as a 2nd person on another persons itinerary, both QR codes res"
479,"Great ... except when it glitches unexpectedly at the VERY last moment. My wife and I decided to go completely electronic on our last flight. No more printed boarding passes. We both had the Delta app on identical phones and could both bring up both boarding passes on either phone. We thought ... even if a glitch on one phone, we could bring up the boarding passes on the other phone. 5 minutes before boarding we both had the Delta app open with both of our boarding passes on the screen. Then, both our apps simultaneously logged off, requiring us to login again with our passwords (which we didn't know). This despite the fact that the app always remembered our passwords in the past. ARGHH... Fortunately, the Delta gate attendant brought up our boarding passes on his terminal and let us on. He acknowledged that others were having the same problems. The fact that both of our apps went down at the same time indicates that this is probably some security measure from the Delta server. OK, if this is necessary at least, let us know."
480,"This app is terrible. Constantly giving errors and has to be restarted, and has also bugged my boarding passes before when travelling with other. Today, I reset my password on the computer because of too many log-in attempts, I go to log in on my app and it says my account is locked and I have to call customer service. What?? But I just reset my password! I go to log back in on the computer - locked as well. Customer service tells me THEY have to wait 24 hrs! Why even tell me to call them???"
481,Crashes every time
482,"I gave up on this app after it repeatedly asked to change phone settings with no luck. Bottom line, the competitor airline apps are easier and don't require this difficulty. As a business traveler the app needs to work all the time or I use another airline. Simple as that."
483,"3 out of 3 times I've used this app, it functions well up until about 2 hours before my flight, at which point my flight details are removed and searching with my confirmation number does not work, forcing me to print a boarding pass. I can screenshot my pass earlier to use it and hope that nothing changes, but this is Delta, and that is not a positive experience. Happy to Updatemy rating if i can get onto a flight 3 times in a row without the app clearing my flight data."
484,"Doesn't consistantly give notifications. On multiple occasions it failed to pull up boarding passes. Behaves erratically when not able to connect to the internet (like when your phone is trying to connect with airport wifi, but the router wants you to agree to Ts and Cs.) User authentication can be difficult."
485,It keeps crashing on my galaxy S9+. I literally have to uninstall and reinstall every time I use it. I don't have this issue with any other apps!!! It's very frustrating and not what I expect from my favorite US carrier!
486,"I have used virtually all the major airline apps and this one is way better than any other. Remembers my info (if I want), tells me when there is a flight delay, tells me where my checked bags are at: if there is a delay that may compromise a connection, it offers suggestions ; helps quickly find the lounge (very important) ;even lets me save a pic of where I parked my car. The only downside is that it is difficult to check in to code shared flights with WestJet but easier than United/Air Canada"
487,Nice app but needs to fix 2 things. I can never pay for my luggage ahead of time. I check in on the app then go to the airport to pay for luggage. I also need to put my KTN in at the airport and the app doesn't Updateby the time I get to security; would be nice to be able to add it via the app. But it does provide good flight and baggage info.
488,"Love the airline and service, but I've not been able to book flights directly through the app for a few months. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, as well as confirming it had all needed permissions, cleared data and cache, and it never lets me select airports. Managing reservations I've created online has never been an issue, but it's slightly irritating that I cannot book through the app. Would be 5 stars if I could book through app successfully."
489,"Logged me out, wouldn't let me log back in, tried MULTIPLE different avenues to attempt, even said my email was invalid. Horrible experience for someone who has an anxiety diagnosis. Do not recommend!!"
490,Never remembers my login information. Now it won't let me log in at all.
491,"It runs constantly in the background even when not used. Even after I kill the app it restarts again and again. I use it maybe once in 2-3 months. So I uninstalled it. I will only install when needed and immediately uninstal it. Delta, you need to do a better job!"
492,"It's always losing my trip right before I need it. It's nuts. I put in my details it finds my trip and then I get in line... Phone screen goes off and I go back to the app and it says ""no trips. Find your trip"". I now have to hold up the line and type my confirmation # back in to pull up my pass. It's soo bad I don't fly delta because of it when I can. Oh, and when trying to type in your name and confirmation to find your trip, if you switch apps it clears the fields!!"
493,"Confusing. Has some good features, but it's almost impossible to find information about upcoming trips. It's way too focused on what's happening in the next 24 hours and selling you upgrades and has way too little useful information about future flights. It's basically a marketing tool for Delta."
494,the app is quirky. on a Samsung 8 it does not all me to purchase flights. continuously kicks the city out..I also have issues checking in. my work around is to. heck in on line THEN it shows up on my phone. All of this defeats the purpose and especially as much as I fly for business and pleasure. I also emailed Delta directly with these concerns with no response
495,"Latest upgrade is broken. My Trips to List Trips to Select Trip to View Bording Pass (4 clicks) goes to a fully new screen that shows a background with small letters about when next trip occurs. Trip notifications are directed to screen that says you have no upcoming trips. Deleted app, reinstalled but this didn't fix the issue. Not usable for showing boarding pass any more, back to paper tickets."
496,"The Android OS app works well enough, though it's not as polished as the app for the iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch, which brings me to my major issue with this app: there is an app for WearOS that shows up on my watch, so I download and install it on my Fossil Sport only to tell me that it's incompatible with that device! It also doesn't work with the Huawei Watch 2, Q Explorist HR, LG Sport, and two other Wear OS devices I've tried, which begs the question: which devices does the Wear OS app work with????"
497,"OK when it works but it doesn't work about 50% of the time. Frequently says ""Oops, something went wrong"" and crashes, or my boarding pass disappears such as yesterday, right before I had to board my plane. Nice going Delta. No option to download the pass for offline use which is essential if the airport has crappy wifi. Doesn't keep you logged in, kept having to look up my confirmation number even though my flight details were there. Check out United's app, theirs is much better."
498,"First time using this app and it worked great. My husband and I each downloaded it and used it for our trip. We received our e-boarding passes within the app, were able to check-in the day before our trip, received important notifications concerning our trip prior to and during it including gate change notifications as well as a delay in boarding message. Very easy to use."
499,Won't allow check-in without location permission. Will not fly with these chumps again.
500,App continues to close in mid-season. Cannot file my report for delayed baggage.
501,"This app constantly crashes. I can't accomplish anything on it - I've restarted the app, I've restarted my phone, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. Nothing works. Just a really poor functioning app. I expected better from Delta."
502,"WARNING - MAJOR PAYMENT BUG!: when you pay for baggage, this app will tell you the transaction couldn't be completed even though it was. So you try again and get charged each time. Now I have to chase Delta for refunds - they never even flagged it or contacted me to refund me for extra baggage payments for a previous flight I took."
503,"Loaded boarding passes on the app, checked our bags and proceeded to security. Scanned my boarding pass fine, scanned my wife's, then when tried to swipe to my child's, got an error, can't load boarding pass. Swiped back to mine, same error. Frustrated and had to go back to check-in counters to print paper passes. Good thing we had plenty of time. Unreliable. Don't depend on it!"
504,"This app sucks. My flight was canceled and decided to download the app to keep current on my connecting flight status. I ultimately missed my connection and was automatically rebooked on the next available flight twice. I only knew this because I was looking directly online. the app still had me on the first flight I missed and if I relied on the app, I would have had no clue what was going on. not to mention it is hard to navigate. I am deleting the app and going to rely on the website."
505,"This is absolutely awful. I used this app and website maybe a two years ago now and it was one of the best experiences. Now, this app and website both suck. Like most reviews complain about already you need to enter your info EVERY time you need/want to see flight status, check in, etc. It is extremely annoying to deal with. The app is literally the website in an iframe. What happened Delta?"
506,"Not a great option for boarding pass. Even though I stay logged into app with frequent flyer number, have to search for flight with name and confirmation number. App boots me out of boarding pass after half hour and have to search again with conf. number. Really inconvenient and pannic inducing if you get booted out right as you reach security checkpoint and have to search through your emails for the stupid conf number. If you can access trip, nice to have updated gate info."
507,"App is garbage. If you don't have internet access the app loses you boarding pass. It supposed to be able to save the boarding pass to your wallet, on Android it does not even give you the option and the iPhone version keeps coming up with errors. App should be simple and have the ability just to save the boarding passes with out needing internet access. Will be deleting the app and going back to paper. So much for trying to save natural resources."
508,Problem all time. Stupid app
509,Log me out and doesn't allow me to log in with the right credentials. Doesn't accept my credit card information. I have to call in to make reservations. Unreliable.
510,Been trying to download app several times over the last month still not successful. Tried with 2 other phones still same issue.
511,"Sends out spam ""test"" notifications"
512,"This app is not easy to use. I cannot navigate through it at all. To be fair, maybe I am just use to the ease of the Alaska Airlines app where I can easily add other family members reservations to my phone too, make changes and contact Alaska Airlines quickly. This will be the first time I fly with Delta. I am optimistic that the flight will be more pleasurable than their app. If not, I will be back to flying only Alaska Airlines."
513,"Functional but crashes a lot. Worst part is every time you need to change your password, this app will log you out and lock your account. Then you have to call in to reset your password again before you can use your account. After several times of doing this, I'm contemplating whether this app is worth having in the first place."
514,"I am not able to login to the app anymore. Something has changed. The usual phone restart, cleanup, Delta app uninstall and install didn't help. I am still able to log in, while using my laptop. Same credentials don't work for the phone app. I'll add more stars, when it is fixed. Samsung Galaxy S8, Android version 9 UpdateJuly 27th, 2019: Back in business, thanks to cust service going extra mile. Happy using this app during every travel of mine. Rating increased. Thank you."
515,"topped working this morning. Everytime I try to login it says, Oops, please enter valid credentials. I can use the same credentials to log into the website from the same phone and other devices. Restart, clear cache, clear data, uninstall/reinstall... no dice, same issue is still there. So the app has rendered itself completely useless for me."
516,Right as you get to the TSA station to go through security at a packed airport is pretty much the worst time for your airline app to crash and dump all your flight info and boarding pass. Had to back out of line and go all the way back to print my boarding pass. Uninstalled the app immediately after that. I could have missed my flight!
517,There's no way to view my return flight's information. The app has no way of reporting issues other than calling a phone number.
518,"t does the job, and is honestly much better than it used to be, but for an app that you expect to use while traveling to just completely not work while you've got a VPN running? Really? You mean I have to open myself up to security risks to use your app? Bad, bad move, Delta."
519,Great app but whenever I'm checking in using the app I have to reinput my travel documentation even though it's already in my profile and when I try to pay for luggage it continually declines or doesn't process the payment regardless of the type of card used. Other than that does everything I need it to. On a Galaxy Note 9.
520,"absolute garbage. the app doesn't even work. had to change my password 8 times. and every time it has said I am not entering ""valid credentials."" the whole point of an airline app is to make it easier for the customer to use and have flight info on their phone. this makes it impossible to even log in to. waste of space and time."
521,"It works almost entirely as it should, but one of the programmers needs to fix the text entries for departure and boarding times. On every single one of my flights it will say something ridiculous like ""departs at 10AM, boards at 1230PM. It's an easy fix and I don't see why it wouldn't be patched."
522,"Very useful; lets you view flights without needing to login/create an account; opened app after flight notice, and was checked in automatically!; good that it only supports portrait orientation (will not accidentally flip when you place it on the reader); (do wish it had a separate ticket view that automatically boosted screen brightness, as other apps do, but on the other hand no problems with default settings)."
523,This app used to run perfectly. Now it seems to log me out just as I am getting ready to board a plane. A page pops up and says 'you have no flights today' as I'm in line to board. It's frustrating. My quick fix it to take a screen shot of my boarding pass or print off my boarding pass. This issue really needs to be fixed.
524,"Always print boarding passes because the app randomly logs you out or crashes, usually when you're in line to board, and you have to have your confirmation number or cc number handy to get your flight info again. When it works it's fine, but I just can't count on it to work."
525,This app worked at one time... But now it just crashes when checking in. So now it seems that I can only use this app to see my boarding pass... But still have to print it... Just in case this app doesn't work... Hmmmm. I only fly Delta due to comfort+... This is not going to change that... But Delta needs to fix this
526,Terrible! I can login to the Delta website and get all of my information but the Delta app doesn't recognize me and wont let me login. Had to go through a third party app to checkin through my phone and get my boarding pass. Third party app even uses my skymiles.
527,"Use Expedia to book. this for just boarding pass. Especially if you plan on buying ""travel insurance"". They can charge you togther over the app, but cant help you past that. Delta needs to do a better job at being responsible for products they sell(3rd party or not). One gal w Delta origionally was helpful, but God help you if you get broken English robots after hours...if you record conversatuons, sugest you review them. May switch back to Alaska after this last episode, but there are some good."
528,"Most of the time when you need to use the app, it will kick you out and you will have to reenter your user name and password. Then it still won't let you in because your password is ""incorrect"". So, you wait 20 minutes, sign in with the same password and it will let you in. Don't close the app though, because as soon as you do and try to get back into it, it will need a password and that password will be incorrect. Really really really frustrating."
529,"Keeps crashing and losing my flight info. It's so frustrating, whether it is going in through the security check point or boarding the plane, this stupid app crashes, can't locate my flights, my trips sucks... so i have to find my confirmation number and find my boarding pass. it's only good for checking in on time. another annoying thing it does is - not Updateany delays. such a rubbish app, might s well just have the boarding pass printed out. giving it one star because i print it out."
530,Best airline period!
531,Really disappointed lately in this app. I constantly have to sign back in and often it doesn't recognize the known password or biometrics. My eyes don't change! I'm Diamond medallion so I use this app nearly every week and it's just not working.
532,"it worked better in the past and has gradually gotten worse. i have to enter my login information everytime, and it dose not have my flights saved in the app when i do login. if you check-in on a computer it does not register on the app. This all makes it difficult to call the app useful."
533,"When i need it to work, it literally makes my info disappear. Its not useful if i have to keep adding my confirmation number only to have it disappear when im boarding a plane. Absolutely ridiculous. Its been useful for some other information like which baggage claim/terminal and gate. They even have airport maps. But literally none of this is useful because the biggest issue is having to readd my trips over and over again."
534,"As others have stated, app loses flight info shortly before takeoff. Crashes when attempting to view boarding pass. Frustrating..."
535,"Can't believe that we had to pay $30 for our luggage. Going and returning home. A total of $60, dollars. The baggage handlers tore up our new luggage. I was very disappointed and dissatisfied with Delta Airlines."
536,The best travel app!!
537,Best airline app I have ever used. Wonderful user experience.
538,"terrible frustrating app. always shows no upcoming flight's, even when i have entered the flight. now i get an alert that it drains my battery, and with no usb on the flights I've had with delta, thats an issue. poorly developed and not easy to use. they should use Alaska airlines app to see one that works."
539,"Very inconvenient app. Used it as guest to check-in. While the checkin itself was smooth, it ""forgot"" my itinerary 3 times. Had to manually re-insert my credentials to see the boarding passes. On top of this, the app does not show the option to email boarding passes! Imagine you are out of data midway through your trip!!!"
540,"Glitchy, gates don't update, keeps telling me to check in when I've already done so, and even one leg complete and waiting on another in the airport. Not user friendly, getting the boarding pass requires experimentation to find the right screen. United's app should be what they aim to achieve."
541,My flight keeps getting removed so I lose my boarding pass when I need it most
542,They should remove this app entirely until they resolve such an enormous problem as randomly DELETING YOUR ITINERARY. Ridiculous.. I always get a printout of my boarding passes just because this app is such a let down. It only surprises me when I can actually use it to board my flight.
543,"I'm using this app for the first time. It dropped my itinerary while I was in one of my connecting airports, so I had to look up my info again elsewhere. The app wasn't really adding any value in the first place, so I'm uninstalling it and not using it again. I'm glad I wasn't relying on it."
544,"Missing one important thing. Users should be able to complain/compliment their flight crew through a form in the app. Click on the flight, click leave feedback about your experience, and allow user to type. i had a great crew bwi->slc, but forgot their names by the time i got internet access."
545,This app works OK generally but I have been having issues with My Trips consistently. I would have an upcoming trip and it would not display and indicate I have no upcoming trips. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app without much improvement. Totally hit or miss if my trips are displayed.
546,Whenever I get a notification about a flight from the app and then I click on the message the app crashes and my boarding pass dissapears. This happens frequently and is unacceptable considering i travel frequently. The whole point of the app is to be more efficient and to have everything accessible in your phone. This terrible app is driving me to look towards other carriers and I have diamond status with Delta 3 years in a row.
547,"I travel a lot on a number of airlines. Delta has the best app, hands down. I like the great variety of information available plus the ability to book and/or change flights easily. The notifications for boarding, baggage status and arrival/departure gates are the best in the business. This is the ultimate airline app."
548,Had to keep adding my flight info so I could use boarding passes at each leg of my trip. Why does it forget this info? Example checked in and as I was walking up to the TSA check point it forgot my info and I had to re-enter the info.
549,This app loves to fail just as I'm approaching TSA and has on a number of occasions forced me to exit a line to go get a paper ticket. It also loves to lock my account claiming failed pw attempts. Maybe others have better luck but my experience has been endlessly terrible. To be avoided.
550,"The app worked great for awhile, but now I cant even look into booking a flight. If you put in an airport in the from and to sections, it stays blank. The number one feature, being able to book or check out potential rates and prices, is unusable. The app was never great, but if it fails to perform its primary function, then it is trash. Just use the website"
551,"The app used to work very well. Recently (since Jan 2020) it is prone to glitches and ghost notifications. Check in gets stuck and abandon the app to check in on website. If first leg of flight requires checking in on partner airline (KLM) the app won't get past the check in and is worthless for the rest of the trip. Baggage notifications work, so 1 extra star for that. But other ghost notifications are annoyances. Attempts to work out issues with Delta chat reps had no solution. Bummer."
552,The app crashed right before I had to scan my boarding pass. It also wiped out all of my trips. Tried logging out and could not log back in. Tried resetting password the email arrived 15 minutes late. Your password cannot be the same as the last one! I just tried logging in with but it told me it's invalid. Anyway after logging back in my trips are still not showing up even though I see receipts for them.
553,"Delta's app and website are terrible. It never remembers your info even though you've checked the box to do so. Then once you've typed in the password; correctly i might add, multiple times, it doesn't work. Reset the password, doesn't work. I wanted to book a vacation with them. Got fed up and booked through a different airline. Stay away from this catastrophe. I'd give it zero but that's not possible unfortunately."
554,"Really cool app. Used it for my trip to and from hawaii. Has maps of the airports, automatic tracking of your bags, gate updates, and departure times. Only hitch I had was it kept losing my flight and I haf to re-enter confirmation info over 10 different times which can get tedius/annoying when you don't know where the hell you are. Great app otherwise."
555,"The app works for booking and getting flight information but it has some serious shortcomings: to do anything it wants confirmation number every time you do flight anything. The confirmation number is not displayed on the online boarding pass, so you have to dig through emails to find it. Then the app forgets it anytime you need updated flight information (gates) if you leave the app. You can purchase checked bags but it doesn't remember the purchase or offer the receipt for expensing."
556,"The app has worked well in terms of keeping me immediately updated of flight changes and luggage status. Unfortunately, it can't fix Delta's terrible track record I've had with them, which meant needing multiple notifications. When a flight needed rescheduled, the app came short by requiring to rebook all legs, without giving the option of only changing the connecting flight. As a result, alternative flight the same night got full by time got through to customer service to change to it."
557,"I have used this app for years and never had any issues until recently. TSA Precheck is not showing on my mobile device boarding pass, but it does show on the paper boarding pass when i go to the counter and have them print it. I have had this problem with the past 3 flights in a row."
558,"Works well most of the time. Would be better with an option to read your password when typing it in, as on the website version. Would also be better to automatically save the boarding passes to the phone such that it is not necessary to login and have web access to find it again"
559,I like the Delta app. It has more options and is better than lots of other airline apps. The only thing they changed that I don't like is on the checkin it does not prompt you for bags. I always check one and many people do not so I can see why. Now I have to reopen it to check bags up front . I know I can do it on the kiosk but like to get done before I hit the airport
560,Logged me out multiple times while at the airport. Had a problem where my flight arrived late and it wouldn't show my originally scheduled connecting flight. It only showed a new flight that I could switch to. Had to look up the flight and gate info manually. Gate staff assured me that I still had a seat on the flight and that my checked bag would make it on the flight as well. Luckily I didn't accept the new connecting flight like the app made me think I needed to do before I talked to the gate
561,"Good app....when it works! I have already checked in for a flight early tomorrow morning, but now the app tells me I ""have no upcoming flights"" and "" find my flight"" can't find my flight. Not the first time this has happened. Restarted the app numerous times over the last 2 hours..still not working."
562,"One of the best airline apps I've come across. I'd still suggest taking a screenshot of your boarding pass or better yet, printing it on paper as a precaution, but I've had no problems with it and I've used it for every function. The boarding notification is also very useful."
563,I used to use delta app 3-4years ago and it was great. Recently started to fly them again and the app won't keep me logged it or pull up my flights unless I use my record locator each time. Very frustrating.
564,"When it works it's fine, but frequently loses track of upcoming trips. Frustrating when you're about to board and suddenly no longer have a boarding pass."
565,"Poor for real needs. You think this apps main purpose is to tell you what your travel plans are and show you your ticket that you just checked in with (and check in before arrival to airport, but that's a failure too) but the app fails more than half the time. It's more frustrating to use. Just expect to use a hard copy ticket to be safe. Now, don't say I didn't warn you! Delta itself is great; it's just a bad app."
566,"It never works!!!! Everytime I attempt to open the app just shuts down. Which defeats the whole purpose of the app. I can't book flights, I can't check-in, I can't use to scan my tickets which means I know have to have a paper ticket. I can't do ANYTHING!!! I have updated, I have uninstalled and reinstalled, nothing works! Someone please fix because this is crazy and very inconvenient"
567,Why does it not show my purchased trips if I'm logged in? Why do I have to search for confirmation number etc. Such a dumb app. Where is the flexible dates option for booking flights?
568,"Nice when it works. But just doesn't load my boarding pass for same day flights majority of my travels. I have to go through their website and manually type in my confirmation to have it text to me. Might be an issue with Android specifically I'm not sure. Has happened with all my devices, so I know it's not a particular phone."
569,"App still doesn't remember password, and makes me reset password almost every time I try to log in. Probably the worst travel app I have ever used by a major airline or hotel."
570,"Sometimes when you checkin on scan your boarding pass for a connecting flight, it removes your flight itinerary. I checked last night and now I have to refind my flight because it removed it. Last week after scanning my boarding pass to get through TSA it removed my flight from the app. Other than that it works, but that's an essential part of the app."
571,Garbage! What is wrong with these people at Delta? How can it possibly be a good idea to disallow access to my upcoming flight info within the app? I have to go over to my email to retrieve a confirmation number every time? What? Get a clue guys! Wake up!
572,"Beyond irritating! App erases your current trip/flight when flying across time zones from East to west, if your flight lands at 2300 and the phone is using plane time which is plus one or two hours. If you want information about the flight you are still on, then you have to manual enter confirmation numbers!!!! You would think the app would keep your current trip for at least 24-48 hours or one or two hours after you have landed local time."
573,"Sheesh this app is frustrating. I use this app BECAUSE I'M FLYING, focus on THAT. As others have said it frequently loses your trips requiring you to reenter you confirmation number/credit card/ticket number. It throws errors constantly. Highly unreliable. Frankly, if you can't get it right for those already flying why in the world would I trust your system to book/buy something else? There are a thousand ways to buy what I want, start by getting it right for those who are already flying."
574,"This app made my first time flying in years much easier and about hassle free . Lots of notifs and updates on flight details, let's you know when it's boarding as well !"
575,"In fairness, I still can't judge accurately, but I'll try again to see if the app still restarts after I manually Force Stop or hibernate it from a utility app, adding to the drain on the battery. Might uninstall & reinstall when needed. To Moto G5+ users w/Oreo 8 & 8.1 who reported this app useless after upgrading, Thanks for the warning. Android 7.0 stays on this G5+. Oreo ruined my other G5+'s personalizations????"
576,"Trips disappear. Every single trip I've used this app for, the trip has disappeared from the app at some point. Usually more than once. Then I need to find my reservation number and search for it again to get my boarding pass. This is very frustrating, it would be great if this was fixed up. Otherwise the app is very good"
577,"Found a perfect flight, selected all my options, went to pay. Input all my information, and it told me I was missing some information. Nothing was left blank, nothing was highlighted in red. Tried 7 times, including starting over from scratch twice. Finally it gave me ""fatal error"" and lost my entire booking. Am not likely to use the app again"
578,"For the amount of dependency they're expecting users to have for this app, it is extremely unreliable and complicated to use. 2/18 -- Downgraded my vote again with this app. It is the least dependable app I have ever used. Constantly crashes. Locks you out and no one at Delta can help you when your in a hurry. Which naturally is when this app decides to screw up."
579,"I am traveling with kids. Upon landing a push notification shows the carousel number. I click it, the notificatio disappears. The app opens but does not show the notification. Notifications section io theapp is empty. Moreover the whole flight is gone as historic. Aparently, creators always offboard in 5 mins and never traveled with kids"
580,"There are some pretty serious design flaws. Their programmers don't seem to want to cache data ; if you lose connectivity, boarding passes can disappear. Seriously... It's an app for a location that frequently does not have Internet access? Why design a point of failure that's in one of the primary"
581,"App loses upcoming trip info constantly. Then have to input confirmation number again to get the trip back. Not good when using it for boarding pass and in line to present to TSA. Also when adding trip to your account, it won't take into account your Known Traveler Number that is already in your profile, which means no TSA pre-check for you. App and system built by amatuers."
582,"After the recent Updateit had signed me out. Normally that wouldn't be such a big deal, but I am unable to sign back in, I am unable to reset my password, and I am unable to look up my username. I keep getting the same message over and over again saying that ""We are unable to do that at this time."" Thats only been happening since the last update, so something had to have gone wrong and needs to be fixed."
583,"This app has the necessary features to be useful, BUT it doesn't retain the info entered by the user. How does that play out as a user experience? Imagine turning your phone's data connection back on after a flight and having to A) look up and enter your Fly Delta app password to open the app for your connecting flight details. Now imagine having to look up and enter your confirmation number to look at those flight details as you're walking across an airport with your carry on belongings in tow"
584,"You know your app is bad when it almost makes someone want to stop using the airline. Mostly started having trouble once I switched back to Samsung. My note 10 cant load boarding passes half the time, wont let me check in even on wifi more than half the time. It's really a bad app. Great airline but it's so dumb that they wont spend just a little more of their large piles of money on a decent app."
585,"This Updateis horrible. It won't remember trips, requiring a confirmation number every single time the app is reopened. Rather defeats the whole convenience of the app if I have to look up the confirmation number and save the boarding pass to photos as a primary document rather than a back up. If there's a gate change, the app doesn't notify, either."
586,"Decent functionality. Bag tracking easier than in the website, for example. BUT: a few days ago I renewed my SkyClub membership online (previously done it at the Club), and thereafter the app started crashing constantly. According to crash logs, obviously a MyWallet-spesific decimal separator problem (dot works, comma crashes), I had to temporarily change the phone language setting to US English to keep the app usable at all until I finish the ongoing and quite complex flight itinerary. Pls fix!"
587,"A lot like Delta's internal systems, the app has been plagued with issues over the past several months. Save yourself the hassle and get paper copies of your boarding passes. Or make certain you save the electronic qr code as being locked out of your boarding passes once past security is a hassle. I"
588,Keeps all info for possible fligjrs and uses the info for higher prices! Very disappointed!
589,The only way to see upcoming trips and check in is to look up the trip via the reservation number (I literally never have that readily available) or enter my 16 digit credit card number...who thought that was a good idea?! This app is so poorly done it makes me want to go back to flying AA just for the ease of use of their app! (I fly for business every single week!)
590,"After I check in, my boarding pass disappears and my trip is no longer listed under my trips. I have to keep looking it up with the confirmation number. Not convenient. I also can't see if my Known Traveler Number on my boarding pass. I just had TSA send me to the back of the security line because I didn't have pre check in my boarding pass. It was there on my out bound trip."
591,"Poorly designed. I signed up and try to log in. It does not recognize my password. When I request to reset password, it takes me to the website, which is also very poorly designed. Also, links in app, when I enter as guest, take me to 404 pages, cannot find page. 12-16-19 Update: Continues to malfunction. It didn't work over the weekend. Now, it won't let me log in."
592,"It is easy to use, but several parts of the app simply don't work. Updating my address, for example... Is does not accept my address, no matter what I do, even though it is correct. Pre-purchasing wifi also doesn't work (they want you to spend extra $8 purchasing during flight, which it suspiciously works...)"
593,"This app could be great except it doesn't store boarding passes on the device and I can't count the number of times I've checked into my flight and at the airport been unable to retrieve my boarding pass without rebooting my phone. In addition, the flight I'm about to get on often mysteriously disappears from my trips the day of travel. Overall I use it because it allows for convenient check-in, but it's otherwise been a disaster for 5 years since I first installed it."
594,"Disgustingly Horrible, every time there is an update! Here I am in the middle of another trip, get a ""test"" message from Delta, and now can't get logged in to the app at all. When it works, it is nice, but the developers are very consistent in breaking it at the worst possible times. Absolutely HORRIBLE quality control before they push it out. SO frustrating!!"
595,"Will uninstall this worthless app once again. I keep hoping and trying this, but it is way behind the screens at the airport"
596,"never works, what's the point. I'm a sky miles member woohoo, I dont feel special at all. ***EDIT*** Now I'm a Silver Medallion, who cares, somehow the app got worse, I can't book flights from it, can't do squat on this app"
597,Finished on first page can't even register.
598,Boarding passes are great in this app
599,"Latest Updatewouldn't open, uninstalled and reinstalled. OK now. LG V35"
600,Same story as many others. Works great when it works. Forgets all your trips every day or two
601,i wish there was a button when youre on your way but about to miss your flight lol . makes you go to website to get # but overall great
602,Great app from booking the flight to getting back home.
603,Won't show my ticket. It just says it's too close to my departure time to check in. I'm already checked in. I'm at the gate. Just show me the **** ticket!
604,"Boarding passes disappear randomly. Seriously, you had one job..."
605,Useless PoC. You can immediately tell it never went through user testing. Blocking an account for trying to log in is the most stupid thing I've seen. And making the user CALL?? An airline??? I'd rather NOT fly Delta.
606,App works fine except for sky club. When I select an airport the app closes. Galaxy S9
607,"It never remembers my flights, and requires me to repeatedly enter my confirmation number to view my boarding pass."
608,"Horrible experience!! Errors while booking international trip of 4 people, Credit card being charged $4.5K Ã 3, one for each error, no confirmation email and most importantly, NO ONE CONTACTED ME TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AFTER EMAILING CUSTOMER SERVICE COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT!!!!"
609,My ticket disappeared and my confirmation no. Wouldn't work AFTER I already checked in.
610,Unable to view boarding passes for my flights MNL > NRT > ATL > MSY. and also unable to message via app.
611,Could use some improvements but probably the best airline app of the US airlines. Delta doesnt seem to take feedback.
612,"Don't log in as guest, as it may forget your boarding pass."
613,"Terrible at finding the flights, use the same information online at get instant results."
614,Glitchy. Forces you to enter confirmation number repeatedly instead of just remembering your trip.
615,So the app crashed while I was trying to cancel a flight that's been PENDING REFUND on their website ALL DAY before it leaves tomorrow and when I relaunched the app it had checked me in!!!! 45 minute wait for a rep and he confirmed the static was HIS END and he'd call me back 50 mins ago! Tried calling back on another line and the wait is 58 more minutes!!! DON'T FLY DELTA!!! IT'S A NIGHTMARE AND I MAY BE OUT NEARLY A THOUSAND BUCKS ON THIS INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT I'M NOT TAKING TO KOREA NOW!!! ??
616,The app continues to get better! When will you add the ability to save my BP to Google Pay? Why do you only support this kind of feature for iOS?
617,App itself works great but visually needs to add nav bar color and add Google pay boarding passes.
618,App couldn't even open for some months now. Scrap it and introduce a better App. Its a disgrace to Delta's HIGH STANDARD in the Airline business.
619,"Hangs and crashes all the time, unreliable app from otherwise reliable air carrier."
620,Doesn't work half of the time . I have to put all my info in each time I use it and then it forgets it then I got to do it again
621,Great to track my baggage and up to date standby list
622,The app of the year for technical difficulties. An almost useless app. Most disappointing.
623,Why doesn't it save boarding passes to Google Pay? Also why does it exit the app when I press the back button? So irritating.
624,Constantly crashes. It won't even open
625,The app logs me off and denies login at the most inconvenient situations. Delta CIO and IT team leaders need a good a$$ kicking to motivate flawless service.
626,"Horrible. All it ever says is, The App is having technical difficulty. Useless app and you certainly can't rely on it for your boarding pass."
627,This app has so many nice touches. My favourite example: weather in your destination is shown in Farenheit. Tap the number and it changes to Celsius. Delightful!
628,"I am a Sky Miles member. I am using this app for the first time. I am traveling tomorrow. I am checked in and feel great! Using the app takes away stress of travel. I also fly needs assistance, so I can be sure there will be travel assistance at every leg of my flights! Thank you, Delta! You are the best!!!"
629,"Worst check in process I've ever had. Every few seconds the app would stop, load something, then take me back to the starting page. The app charged me for a checked bag (got credit card notification), then said ""sorry, we could not process your order."" I had to fill in my information multiple times. It took nearly 20 minutes instead of the usual 20 seconds. Nothing loads. Half the features are broken. Tried checking in through an iPhone, that was just as bad. - I don't plan on flying Delta."
630,"Constantly forgets my trip that I am on despite me entering the confirmation number many many times. When I need a boarding pass and it suddenly forgets that I'm going to be flying today, that's not very helpful. By the end I had memorized my number because I had to enter it so many times. Overall slow and clunky. Love flying delta but sheeeeesh."
631,"Does not recognize my login/ password etc. I had restarted my password just for the sake of it although I didn't need to. I tried again, and still says credential not recognize. Just terrible.. I was this close to purchase a flight with delta. Given this hassel I don't see my self using this app nor delta in general. Fix this up Delta, I had seen you as high standard and was thinkingb of become loyal customer. But ever time having an issue logging in is not convenient"
632,"The app is okay and does its duty... **Navigation within app** Compared to the iPhone version, I think the navigation without buttons on the bottom for easy access of My Delta/Today/etc is a bit annoying (you first need to click the burger menu, then select...) - so usability-wise, I much prefer this feature on the iPhone version. **Accessing the boarding passes** Also, please integrate a pkpass export into Google Pay (like you do for Apple Passbook), or implement at least an Android notification (starting 3 hours before the flight) that brings you directly to the Today view - which would make it much easier to quickly access the boarding pass. Looking forward to future updates - and keep climbing!"
633,"Would be great if it works. This app has the uncanny ability to lose my reservation in the app almost every time I'm standing at the gate waiting to check in, or at passport control when I need to scan in. Suggest screenshotting your QR code boarding pass so you don't lose it at crucial moments."
634,The book function from the app does not work. I cannot change the destination.
635,"Won't even allow me to set up my account. Guess through the whole process, to then give me an error message at the very last step. I do get an email welcoming me, but when trying to log in it tells me I don't have an account. Tried setting up my account again, same issue."
636,I think they intentionally made it difficult to use. It forget your trip. give you a panic heart attack when you trying show your boarding pass at gate. it tell you to log in. It should not need rocket science to fix those bugs. Very annoying.
637,"Easy to navigate, and fast."
638,"Easy user interface, accurate and timely updates while in flight and at the airports. Check-in is very easy, and I screenshot the QR code temporarily in case I have connection issues when approaching security. If in flight entertainment with Delta Studio was more integrated with the app that would be nice. Downloading another app and waiting for the links to load in a separate window when selecting movies is inconvenient."
639,"Constantly will not show seat assignments and will give a ""oops something went wrong and to try back later"". Gold members are to be able to access to seat selection 72hrs in advance but it doesn't seem to allow that anymore, just gives error codes."
640,At the check mark for check-in there is larger font reads 14 hours to check-in. Lower down in smaller font it reads 1D 14 hours check-in. Make both places read the remaining time before check-in. In other time zones that could be confusing. No flight in to Philippines but app did advise me not to go to the airport. App was useless in that regard. App needs much work.
641,Why such important information as boarding pass is not stored locally and readily accessible? Why half of the time after I background the app I have to search for my flight again entering the confirmation number? The app has some nice features like airport map but surprisingly lack a simple convenient functionality.
642,"This app is GARBAGE! Do NOT use this app to check in for international flights or it will screw you and you'll have to arrive at the airport an additional 2 hours early for your flight. Or better yet, just book the flight with American, United, or any other airline that has an app that works correctly."
643,"Thanks for making the TSE checkmark so small on the new app interface that even with bifocals you can't see it and for making it bright red instead of blue so that you think something's wrong when you open your app. Nice changes, why don't you consider people who actually fly and use the app and make the TSA Pre sign visible to someone who just glances at their phone without their glasses on even with bifocals it's too small to see."
644,"If a companion is traveling in the same flight with a separate ticket, please provide the ability to tie their PNR(confirmation number) on the app so if we select seats adjacent to each other, we do not lose that because of upgrades for one of the passengers."
645,"Update: latest version still has the same bug. Pretty good app, except that when traveling with multiple passengers, it presented the wrong barcode to security. Finally tried the other barcode with their name and came up as mine on TSAs scanner, but that's a pretty serious flaw in the app!"
646,"While the Delta App is what it is (a airline application) I haven't used it in quite some time. Today, it popped up with a notification on my phone with the title and text of ""test"". Sounds like a compromised application; no thank you. Uninstalling."
647,"Used to love the app. Clean UI. Gives me quick control of critical features. But then with a build this year, it gets hung loading constantly. Only resolves with closing and reopening the app then waiting. It's the one thing ruining the app."
648,"SUPER clunky app. Poor design. When trying to create a SkyMiles profile, I filled out all the fields before it told me my password was invalid. I had to fill the whole thing out 5 or 6 times because it kept copying info I'd filled out into the wrong fields and causing different errors."
649,"Get error messages when I try to reset my password. Only option is to call customer service. Locked out of account. Call customer service. ""Please say or enter your long-ass delta account number."" Pass."
650,Nice idea and mostly works well. Functions are too limited vs website and experience way too many errors when trying to book or purchased upgrades to seats. Don't offer a seat upgrade and then tell me you can't process it. Please fix these issues.
651,Very limited functionality. It also never seems to remember you username when you ck the box. It also seems to take 4 times for the password to work. It always says you have entered the wrong pw. Very poor app.
652,Ahh!! It's twice now that the app decides to forget my flight and boarding pass while in line. How have they not fixed the need for internet access yet? Take screenshots of your boarding passes if you use this app.
653,"Locked me out of my medallian account by repeatedly trying to connect with wrong password after I changed password via web site. Then told me to call customer service to unlock account, but customer service says I have to wait 24 hours after last logon attempt. Lots of bugs when it did connect."
654,"Often can't find your flight or say it is ""unable to find your reservation with infomation I provided"" even though the info provided is correct. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it is very frustrating."
655,"This app sucks compared to literally all other airline apps. Look at Alaska or United to see what a good one looks like. Delta inexplicably just seems to open your browser to their site, and is not at all tuned to mobile devices."
656,"This used to be one of my favorite airline app (and still is from a functionality standpoint) but ARE YOU KIDDING with the new design and color scheme? It hurts the eyes, is not consistent, light blue, dark blue, hot pink, white - what is going on??? I think there have been more than enough negative reviews complaining about the revised design - you should seriously consider reverting back."
657,"It's a nice app and worked for my flights... When it actually worked. There's a constant issue with it forgetting your ""trip"" so you have to enter your confirmation code over and over again (usually at the most inconvenient time). Or the app will refresh while you're using it and forget the very trip you're looking at, so you have to put your code in again. Super annoying."
658,"Just got a notification that only said ""test"". Now I think it's only a matter of time before I start getting notifications for ads. So the test mostly just reminded to uninstall the app."
659,"Buggy. Added my flights to the app, which seemed to save them. When I tried to check in, the app lost my flights. It lost them again when I tried to board. I pretty much need to type in my confirmation number each time. Also: really poor experience purchasing Wi-Fi. I bought Wi-Fi while booking a flight, and I was charged for it. The app has no record of that and even gives me the option to buy Wi-Fi for the same flight. No mention of Wi-Fi in any emails either. When I called Delta, they told me I had to call a different company."
660,"The app now logs me out every time I come back into it on my phone if it was already open. Having to log in every time I want to check my gate is insane. Basically use the app to open your boarding pass, then screenshot the pass, because when you try to pull up your pass at the gate, it'll log you out then have to reload the pass. If you don't want to hold up the line behind you just screenshot or print your boarding passes, cause this app is a buggy mess."
661,This is the worst app I've had. I cannot log into my account with it. There seems to be nice features - if I could ever use them. I can log on with my computer and through the browser on my phone - just not through the app.
662,"2019 Oct: I simply don't get it. Let's take this use case: I am in comfort, and 2nd on the upgrade list for 1st class. I see that there are 3 available in 1st class. I click on the seat map but it shows no available seats. However, if I go to Book, select the same date and flight, I can see the seats. WHY? Why work so hard for this info?"
663,Love Delta (relatively to other airlines) but the app leaves a lot to be desired like actually working. Check in doesn't work half the time. ?? When you land it displays a message about where your bag is going that disappears when you try to read it. Why do I have to put in my confirmation# etc. to pull up info. Isn't not having that info whole point of using when that's the point of having the app!? Boo!
664,"Good when it works. Often times doesn't work. The last two days, all I can get is a notice that the app is having technical difficulties. I'm a very frequent customer of Delta and find them to be a good airline BUT a major housecleaning of the I.T. department has long been needed...for years now. C'mon Delta, hire some good professionals for the job."
665,Add Google Pay and face unlock functionality
666,"There is no option to save your boarding pass to your phone. This is important since the app randomly loses boarding passes. I was unable find the boarding pass for the flight I was boarding; the today section didn't think I had any flights, even though I had used it less than half an hour prior to go through security. I had to get out of line and punch in all my flight info, including card number, to find it. Print a paper pass as a backup."
667,"App ""dropped"" my boarding pass; had to be replaced with paper. I had my boarding pass in this app, and it worked without issue while I went through security. However, by the time I got to the gate, the app logged me out, and then when I re-entered my login information, it wouldn't show me my boarding pass anymore! The gate agents were willing to print me a new one -- but I had to wait in line, and it would have been faster and less stressful to just start off with a paper boarding pass."
668,"App is fine when it works, but in both my samsung s9 and s10+ every so often all my trips disappear. I have to retype them in one by one. Imagine how nice it is when you are boarding and your boarding pass is not there anymore... and you have to ask to print your boarding pass. From business class, you end up boarding as the last person on the flight. Plus check-in process most of the time does not get the information from the profile, forcing you to input name passport all of it ... unreliable."
669,"Figured by now you should be able to pull up your boarding pass anytime. Never fails, I have my boarding pass open and ready to scan, only to have my screen shut off and to turn it back on as I'm approaching the boarding doors or tsa, only to see a blank screen... This has been happening for years. I now take a screenshot because the app sucks so bad!"
670,"Fall from Grace... The good: it's a nice looking app, colors and all. The bad: it will leave you at the gate without a way to board. Was in line, ticket showing on screen. Then boom, app refreshed, now all of my flight and everything is gone. Requires that I log in, and after, still no tickets. I'd expect more from a startup, as an experienced app developer, consumers deserve more."
671,"If you are flying Delta, download this app for-sure! It was incredibly helpful. Just show your boarding pass right on the phone. Gives updates on your flight status, and if your flight has a major delay, quickly gives you other flights that you can switch to with the touch of a button to get you to your destination as soon as possible. You can even track your checked luggage. I'll never fly without it. Thank you for making such a useful app!"
672,"This app is very reliable - in the sense that anytime you know you really need it, anytime you're at the airport, you'll receive a ""technical difficulties"" error message."
673,The app is constantly resetting even while my boarding pass is displayed. To have the app reset and make me search for my itinerary again and again while in line for security and for boarding is a huge fail for an airline app.
674,"Probably one of the best airline apps available. It can be used to book, manage, upgrade flights. Good info on flight departure and arrival, including weather. Plus the feature to track your bag.Â "
675,"I have to take another star away from this app, as the latest versions now feature ""obnoxious white background"" mode. Whether you're on an overnight red-eye, a passenger in a dark car at night, or in a darkened conference room at work, prepare for the pain of being blinded while having everyone nearby glare at you with scorn as you open the Fly Delta app. This app needs a dark theme or night mode as a settings option really badly! Ugh!"
676,"When I initially installed the app I would have given it 4 stars. But now every time I attempt to choose a flight to book I always get an error message saying ""Oops! We're sorry...no flight search results matching the criteria could be found. Even deleted and reinstalled the app. Continue to get the same message. I use a Samsung S10."
677,"Terrible experience!!!!! All the information I had to reenter since I did that months ago! Time consuming and for that matter nerv wrecking! What is the purpose of an app if it does ask for the exact same information I have already entered? Gladly, I was at home so I could gather all the information I have already entered. Just to be sure, I did screenshots of the boarding passes since I have learned that a few passengers ran into issues with boarding passes not appearing. Delta, you can definitely do better > I am rooting for you guys!"
678,"Kept losing my travel info. Seriously, how many times do I have to put it in? This app needs work. It lost my ticket info as I was boarding the plane. Didn't have my phone in airplane mode either. Try again."
932,"I would give it three stars if this was only for domestic flights. I tried this for my family's trip from a US city to Cancun. The check-in worked fine though I had to enter passport information for myself, my wife and son. But several significant problems happened after that. 1. The app does not provide an offline mode. When we arrived at Cancun, and went through the custom and security, I was asked to show boarding passes. At that time. my cell phone was not connected to the network via WiFi. When I opened the app, it tried to update the information and said something like ""need to be connected to network"". I couldn't find a way to show e-boarding passes. 2. There is no way to show e-boarding passes after the flight has arrived at the destination. So, in my case, I guess I couldn't have shown the e-boarding passes at the security anyway even if the app was connected to the network. 3. For our return flight, I tried to check in at the hotel. But the app didn't allow me to do so. It only worked for my son because he is a US citizen. My wife and I had to check in at the airport. So, it is useless for international flights."
939,Fails to update flight info such as gate# and departure time even though all the info at 24 hr prior check-in and info at airport arrival is up to date. The app's flight departure time and gate info doesn't get accurate info until the plane that you're leaving on has actually landed at your airport. Just print boarding pass on a PC and do it the old way. At least you'll have the info. App also feezes and needs to be restarted.
952,"I use this app every time I fly. about 4-6 times a month. It's very good WHEN IT WORKS. If there is any sort of flight delay the app becomes completely useless. 9 times out of 10 it doesn't update to your latest flight if they rebook missed conmections. I also travel with a dog, when you do that the airline doesn't let you check in on the app, which is fine. But once I check in at the airline the app should start working as normal, But it Doesn't! It also has constant errors when picking seats."
956,"app did not update my connecting flight information (gate, boarding time), even though the gate was listed 24 hours ago when I printed my boarding pass. choose the track my bags button and I was required to put on my bag numbers - I did not have to do this with the United app. the app does not give the information about the flight (power, wifi, food, etc)"
964,"3 out of 3 times I've used this app, it functions well up until about 2 hours before my flight, at which point my flight details are removed and searching with my confirmation number does not work, forcing me to print a boarding pass. I can screenshot my pass earlier to use it and hope that nothing changes, but this is Delta, and that is not a positive experience. Happy to update my rating if i can get onto a flight 3 times in a row without the app clearing my flight data."
968,Nice app but needs to fix 2 things. I can never pay for my luggage ahead of time. I check in on the app then go to the airport to pay for luggage. I also need to put my KTN in at the airport and the app doesn't update by the time I get to security; would be nice to be able to add it via the app. But it does provide good flight and baggage info.
995,"I am not able to login to the app anymore. Something has changed. The usual phone restart, cleanup, Delta app uninstall and install didn't help. I am still able to log in, while using my laptop. Same credentials don't work for the phone app. I'll add more stars, when it is fixed. Samsung Galaxy S8, Android version 9 Update July 27th, 2019: Back in business, thanks to cust service going extra mile. Happy using this app during every travel of mine. Rating increased. Thank you."
1010,"Keeps crashing and losing my flight info. It's so frustrating, whether it is going in through the security check point or boarding the plane, this stupid app crashes, can't locate my flights, my trips sucks... so i have to find my confirmation number and find my boarding pass. it's only good for checking in on time. another annoying thing it does is - not update any delays. such a rubbish app, might s well just have the boarding pass printed out. giving it one star because i print it out."
1032,"Really cool app. Used it for my trip to and from hawaii. Has maps of the airports, automatic tracking of your bags, gate updates, and departure times. Only hitch I had was it kept losing my flight and I haf to re-enter confirmation info over 10 different times which can get tedius/annoying when you"
1033,"The app was great but the update often shows no flights at crucial times such as when making a connection. Also my husband and I have 2 different sky miles accounts yet his flights and boarding passes show in his and mine, on 2 separate phones. Something is wrong."
1034,"Often flight info just disappears forcing to use ""Find My Trip"" again. Unable to view seat availability when flight is operated by a partner airlines."
1035,Not bad does well with standard flights but once flights are delayed the info is unreliable and the system handles these changes very poorly. The only reason i can't give this app a 5 star.
1039,"Latest update wouldn't open, uninstalled and reinstalled. OK now. LG V35"
1040,"The app is okay and does its duty... **Navigation within app** Compared to the iPhone version, I think the navigation without buttons on the bottom for easy access of My Delta/Today/etc is a bit annoying (you first need to click the burger menu, then select...) - so usability-wise, I much prefer thi"
1041,"Easy user interface, accurate and timely updates while in flight and at the airports. Check-in is very easy, and I screenshot the QR code temporarily in case I have connection issues when approaching security.

1043,"I generally like this app much more than other airlines, but for over three years I have been seeing ""Sorry, a fatal error has occurred..."" when clicking View Seats/Seats. At a MINIMUM, from a basic user experience standpoint, remove the word ""fatal."" I work in mobile app dev, this is Marketing 101,"
1044,"Great for expediting my travel experience. My only complaint is when it asks for an option to upgrade seats, my second flight after a connection does not show me on both the first class and the comfort plus upgrade lost. The app seems to just choose one at random. Not a huge deal, I know, but a glit"
1045,Won't let me print a paper bdg pass any more Like it as a backup if phone freezes or dies unexpectedly
1046,"Pretty accurate app, I'm pleased for now."
1047,Pilots amazing what they do!!! My first time flying loved flight to cities very fast. Now from cities to cancun was a little scary about last hour or 2 due to turbulance. Well if people would just stay seated probably not so bad. Hated waiting to get to ur seat n get off the plane! Worst part. Oh an
1048,"This last trip had a delay due to weather. The app told me that it was running late and suggested that I get a different connecting flight. It was so helpful and that new flight was at no charge (maybe because I had the insurance?) The reason for the 4 stars is that, while it was usually great at re"
1051,"I love the app but, it does not let you check in for your flight. Also, there is a glitch where when you minimize the app, any info that was input disappears. Sometimes multi-city flights will disappear after, making one flight. Please fix these issues."
1052,Overall a pretty decent app. Only issue is lately I'm getting my baggage loading and unloading notifications about a week after the fact. Just got one late last night saying my bag is now on the carousel. I've been home for 6 days.
1053,Once I'm logged in I should not need to enter my name and confirmation number every time I want to see my upcoming flights. They should just be available for me to click on.
1054,Should be able to use your regional upgrades and other certificates on the app.
1055,Not allowing me to check in thru the app
1056,Overall great app. would give it 5 stars if I had the ability download a copy of my boarding pass. Keep up the great work Delta!
1057,sometimes a little wonky when boarding pass updates and with checked luggage. otherwise not bad. can even book flights in flight if connected to wifi.
1058,gave me all of my flight information and kept it updated for me so i could find my gates. I recommend this to anyone including first time flyers because for my first time flying they helped me make it easier.
1059,"no pre-tsa identification on boarding pass is a pain because i have to stop for a printout before security. othewise, great app."
1060,I experienced great service while on flight....but I experienced a lot of turbulence on my connecting flight ....nearly made me sick. but all and all it went well.
1061,"easy to look up flight and seat availability. but, I don't think it accounts for the oversold flights and shows available seats when in fact not the case."
1062,"I have the same general issues that most people have had. It loses trips just about every time I travel. When I try to reenter my info it can't find the trip at all. It also carries over to the website so luckily I screen shot my boarding passes as soon as i get them. Awesome idea, terrible executio"
1063,Logged me out multiple times while at the airport. Had a problem where my flight arrived late and it wouldn't show my originally scheduled connecting flight. It only showed a new flight that I could switch to. Had to look up the flight and gate info manually. Gate staff assured me that I still had a
1064,The app used to work very well. Recently (since Jan 2020) it is prone to glitches and ghost notifications. Check in gets stuck and abandon the app to check in on website. If first leg of flight requires checking in on partner airline (KLM) the app won't get past the check in and is worthless for the
1065,"The app works for booking and getting flight information but it has some serious shortcomings: to do anything it wants confirmation number every time you do flight anything. The confirmation number is not displayed on the online boarding pass, so you have to dig through emails to find it. Then the a"
1066,"Poor for real needs. You think this apps main purpose is to tell you what your travel plans are and show you your ticket that you just checked in with (and check in before arrival to airport, but that's a failure too) but the app fails more than half the time. It's more frustrating to use. Just expe"
1067,"Sheesh this app is frustrating. I use this app BECAUSE I'M FLYING, focus on THAT. As others have said it frequently loses your trips requiring you to reenter you confirmation number/credit card/ticket number. It throws errors constantly. Highly unreliable. Frankly, if you can't get it right for thos"
1068,"Nice when it works. But just doesn't load my boarding pass for same day flights majority of my travels. I have to go through their website and manually type in my confirmation to have it text to me. Might be an issue with Android specifically I'm not sure. Has happened with all my devices, so I know"
1069,"So the app deleted my flight info after I got into the TSA with it and I had to scramble through multiple of their emails to find the confirmation code, which was link which opened the app but also still couldn't find my flight ... had to *manually* type it in...no prob but unnecessarily complicated"
1070,"Decent app when it works. The check in function has not worked for my last three flights. This is incredibly inconvenient. When I am able to check in, the app has a tendency to crash right as I need to scan my ticket. Helpful tip- screen shot your ticket if you are lucky enough to be able to access"
1072,"In fairness, I still can't judge accurately, but I'll try again to see if the app still restarts after I manually Force Stop or hibernate it from a utility app, adding to the drain on the battery. Might uninstall & reinstall when needed. To Moto G5+ users w/Oreo 8 & 8.1 who reported this app useless"
1073,"This app sucks, not only does it lack basic features that the other major airlines have (such as making same day flight changes), but it is also pretty confusing to use. I am in my twenties so naturally I am pretty good with technology and apps, but this one manages to confuse me at times."
1074,"Keeps saying I hit my limit on password entries even right after I update my password, so it's an endless cycle. I have better luck going directly to the site via a browser."
1075,"Why does the app have to crash every time someone asks to see my boarding pass? Even the Delta staff joke that you are better off taking a screenshot than relying on the app... Other than that, the app is really great! ..have you guys tried testing the app before releasing?"
1077,"It has all the functions it should, but it is consistently forgetting my trips. I'll be in the middle of a trip looking for my connecting flight info and be forced to re enter my information multiple times per trip. Extremely annoying."
1078,Slow to update and receive data. I lose my boarding pass to often and have to wait after it kicks me out.
1079,"My boarding pass vanished from the app multiple times within an hour, leaving me to scramble as I boarded, what exactly is the point of this app?"
1080,"When it works, it's fine. Keep getting locked out and account froze. App drops intermittently usually at boarding when I'm trying to display my boarding pass."
1081,Great when it works. When you change your password you are automatically locked out of the app for 24 hours.
1083,"Tracking map will not work when looking at flight status... when clicked, it says app is not working and exits out of the entire app."
1095,Booking references not found? I can check my booking just fine on air Canada website so this app is not working. Update 27.2.2020 - it's working again. Hopefully it still works after future updates.
1096,You went from being a useable app which allowed you to basically check everything about your flight to basically a bloated app that points to your website. Worst is you are forced to update the app!
1098,What a garbage app. Doesn't update any information (Gate.. seat ) and it keeps giving me an error when adding the boarding pass. Such an embarrassment.
1103,"Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Old App gave you so much more! Used the App in December to do an e-upgrade for my self and a companion, received a confirmation, then when arrived at airport there was no upgrade applied. The ticket counter couldn't fix it as they can no longer upgrade seats to Business Class, so ended up in some lousy seats in Economy. But here's the kicker, they took the upgrade credits anyway and 6 weeks later still have not given them back!"
1104,Absolutely horrible app. Basic functions such as Upgrades and Check in to flights does not work. I (50K Gold) tried to upgrade tickets on our honeymoon flight and app would not work. Direct aerplan member reservations hotline and staff at YYZ completely unfriendly and unwilling to help. Travel a lot for work and have always had good experiences. However when it came to the honeymoon flights and AC change to the new system it's been a complete failure. Do not use this app for any AC service.
1105,"Updated Jan 25. Still buggy, and no seat preview and NO CALENDAR SYNC. PLEASE PUT BACK THE CALENDAR SYNC. Awful. Two weeks later and still absolutely awful. I cannot put my flight pass bookings on this even manually! I cannot get my boarding pass for my flight today. That is the one thing that this app is supposed to let you do. Plus you cannot see seats anymore you can't sync with your calendar, I can go on forever. What an absolutely useless piece of junk."
1106,"Thanks for not improving the app. Bug fixes dont count. Now it crashes too! Come on AC - why no response about the app? STILL NO CALENDAR INTEGRATION!!! New interface is awful, no info summary or main page check in or boarding pass. I thought the United app from 3 years ago was bad. Shame on you for changing. There was no need. Can I give this ZERO stars?"
1107,"New app is awful. Missing a lot of functionality that was previously included. I can't even see what seats I've booked for a reservation. This is basic information that should be in any airlines app. Between this and the debacle with the new reservation system Air Canada has really dropped the ball. Update: Now the app is missing trips and is constantly showing errors when trying to add them. Again, this is basic stuff an airline app should be able to do."
1108,"Update : Now that the tech issues have been addressed, changing to 4 stars from 1 star earlier. The checkin functionality is great and also like to call out ability to view incoming flights, often 3-4 flights down. Need to have Altitude Status and progression integrated into the app."
1109,"This is the message I've gotten all day each time I try to use the app typical Air Canada all excuses no action. "" Our apologies, we have encountered a system error and unfortunately we are unable to complete your check-in at this time"" You may also attempt to check in on our website, at an airport kiosk or at a Check-in Assistance counter. Doesn't work on the website either so much for getting a decent seat"
1110,There are features of this app which I appreciate such as tracking the inbound flight. But compared to the previous version much needs to be done to make this useful. As of now you can't get or update your seats. I frequently get messages that my booking has been changed but there's nothing to tell me what's been changed. I even got a message that a flight was cancelled only to have it reinstated 5 minutes later after I had contacted reservations to put myself on another flight. Etc.
1111,"Worse than the previous version. Harder to navigate. Doesn't show purchase details like Bistro vouchers like the old app did. I would have expected a better overall experience given it was a complete rewrite of the app... What is worse is the sheer number of other AC clients all saying the same thing, the previous app was pretty good, this one is horrid. Can't book flights, or find basic info. Old flights keep showing up. Someone should be fired and yet I doubt AC is reading these reviews."
1112,"Complete junk. Can't even find my bookings. Useless. Shameful. Unacceptable. Bad. Update: a month after its inception it is still not working. I have two international bookings with AC, both of which changed booking numbers in AC's new reservation system. This dumb app can't find either one, under the old or new booking number. It is incredibly thoughtless of Air Canada to not have resolved this yet. One month later still, my bookings appeared for a while but then disappeared again."
1114,this app is pretty but does not work. very frustrating when trying to use it for its intended purpose and it just does not work.
1116,"This is most useless app I have ever tried to use. After I entered my reservation number, it showed the basic information and nothing else. I could not see any details, make corrections or do anything else. This has to go!"
1118,The app no longer connects to my 1 year old tablet. Worked last year but not now. Looks like air Canada want to charge you $10.00 to rent there iPad if you want entertainment. Just another rip off by air Canada. Sorry for air Canada your not getting g a y more money ey from me. $6000 for a week vacation and you cant even get your app to work right. You should be fired for your poor service e.
1119,I had access to all my trips as of last Thursday....now all gone....I cant add them back in...I have been in contact with Air Canada on Facebook messanger...I was told to delete the app and download again...I have done that several times....and was also told to go to Air Canada website to check... and that site wont let me sign in....unbelievable....and stressful....I am hoping we are still on the flights we had booked. .... and that I can check in online on Monday....
1120,"Thso app doesnt work, and wastes timee. I made 5 attempts to check in and app wouldn't do it. I messaged for help and got told to go to a kiosk when I arrive. AC respondent wouldn't recommend trying ant other method for help. So I tried from their website and it worked fine. I am uninstalling this app. A complete waste of time."
1122,Unable to add an existing booking. Logging in doesn't reflect my associated reservations.
1124,"One of the worst aps i have on my phone. I have no idea how to use this and what it can do. A complete moron could design a better product. I want to check in, eupgrade, waitlist and as far as i know this does nothing. I guess all the IT people at AC are dealing with the waaaay bigger issue of booking software. AC should win the award of worst IT team ihe country. Thank God their pilots can fly well cause this team is ""spare parts""!!!"
1125,"Possibly worst app I have used, worse than their last app. Delta's app crushes this one,maybe they should copy it ? App difficult to use, crashes alot and even dumps boarding passes. Lots of oops messages. No surprise from Air Cannot ( sorry spell check). Would give it 0 but 1 is lowest."
1126,This is by far the worst airline app. Even budget airlines have better app. It takes 30 min to check in and 9 out of 10 time I can't even get a boarding pass in the app. I have to print it out even in the airports with the ability to scan passes.
1127,"The worst app I've ever used. I should say tried to use. It won't let me enter a trip to Australia, get a message that can not process request when I enter same booking info as online web site. Garbage. Shameful. If a Zero score was available I would have given the app zero.Â "
1128,"The new application crashes after 20 second. It must have crashed 10 times. I could not even check in for a flight without it crashing Still having issues month later. Stops half way check-in, invalid boarding pass, random flights added. Not impressed"
1129,"Horrible. Last yr, when we tried to download the app on our 1yr old android tablet it wont work. My even older tablet worked. Then this yr, both tablet cant download. It say it isn't compatible. This is horrible app if only selected devices can download app. NEED TO FIX"
1130,Can't add any upcoming flights to this. Gives an error each time
1131,"Wow so bad... Even months after it launched! I can't get accurate flight info from the platform. It crashes all the time, too."
1132,"Bearbone app that doesn't do much. It keeps saying an update is available but when I try to download update, nothing happens. The app itself won't let you do basic stuff like changing your seat."
1135,Garbage app and airline!! I cant check in with all international cities. Only certain ones. Also our flight # got changed with no notification at all! On top of that no info on our codeshared flight.
1136,"No matter how many times I try I cannot check in, without Air Canada telling me there's some error. Combine this with the brutal service and canceled flights I'm done. Westjet all the way from now on"
1137,This is a complete and utter joke. It won't find your bookings. It won't let you add them manually-- although it says you can. Most times it won't even let me log on. A disaster. Everyone responsible for this app should be fired
1138,"Get ""An error occurred that we didn't expected"" when trying to enter my booking details. Phoned Air Canada Customer Services who told me to email their Android support address. Unsurprisingly, I never received a response."
1139,"Everytime we try to use it there's a problem. Never had a successful check-in. Always get an error, luggage payment went through but it says 0 luggage on the app, etc.."
1140,I can't add my flight booking. I can't access my ticket. I pretty much can't use the app for anything it's MEANT to be used for. I'll change my rating once these are fixed
1141,"I want the old application! The current one has buggs, and it doesn't show any important information, I only can see those in the the super slow website."
1142,Terrible app. Won't let me check in 3 flights in a row and locks up all the time. Crappy just like the mismanaged airline. Seeing an average of 1.9 stars was not a shock.
1143,Booking reference is 7 digits & app only accepts 6? If it's something I'm doing please help. Looks like it might be quite good once I am able to get my reservation registered.
1144,How to check your past trips? That option is gone. Aeroplan number doesnt apply automatically when you book ticket through app. Aeroplan nmbr gets earsed automatically and ask me to login again
1146,This app doesn't work at all. Old app was fantastic this one is waste of time.
1147,"Painfully bad! Limited reason for using the app as you will be forced on to the website for anything useful. Eup availability works sometimes. It will store boarding pads, other than that nothing. M"
1148,Won't let me add my trip to the app. Error keeps happening.
1149,Needs more functionality. Also standy and upgrade list works sometimes. No LHR flight departures avail today or tomorrow for instance. Very unreliable compared to old app.
1150,"Far less functional than previous app. Need to dig through multiple screens to find boarding passes, no way to save boarding pass to Google wallet."
1151,"Forced app update at the security line, and it didn't retain any login information. Thanks, but no thanks, Air Canada."
1152,"It was working fine, up until I had to board and the app wouldn't open. Couldn't retrieve my boarding pass. Luckily I took a screenshot just in case."
1154,Can't look up upcoming trips on this app. It just returns errors and tells me to try again later
1155,Very glitchy. Worse than the previous app. Don't depend on it for boarding passes with tight connections.
1156,App does not show my bookings and will not sync with my account online. The old app used to work perfect. This is not acceptable!
1157,Each version getting worst. Latest would not even allow to use it on Rouge on a Chromebook. Demands to be on Airplane mode - which cannot be done on a PC without SIM card.
1158,Don't work. Don't recognise valid booking numbers. This New version don't deliver. Totally useless I'm never sure of my travel plans.
1159,"Difficult to use, everytime I try and view a flight status it errors out. Nice job messing it up, the old app never this many issues"
1160,"The new updated app is very badly designed. There is no notification to check-in, can't e-upgrade from within the app."
1161,"Doesn't work anymore Can't add trips, keeps saying it's a problem on their end. Anything I try to do, it crashes."
1163,P.o.s. app trying to check-in sitting on a beach in cost rica. And the app keeps crashing. Had to borrow someone elses phone and checked-in for my wife and I. Fail. Now I will have to waste vacation time sitting on the phone trying to get it sorted out. Air canada - get your head out of your ass and fix your app. It's been months of nothing but issues for us frequent flyers
1164,"Terrible app .. slow, poorly designed, makes you want to fly any other airline. Should look at Delta to see how to make a user friendly app."
1165,"How.... How can this app be this bad.. how do you go from a perfectly good, functional app to this steaming pile of garbage. Features that used to work, no longer work at all or are just missing. Prestige members? Who the f cares about them anymore. Let's take away all the perk features or make them impossible to redeem on the app. WestJet is looking better and better by the day"
1166,The app no longer updates the boarding pass when flights are delayed and your seat changes. Sort of useless now.
1167,Terrible buggy mess. Can't even add an existing booking or anything.
1168,an.2nd still buggy. At times it refuses to open. Not user friendly at all.
1169,pp is awful at the best of times. Flying air Canada is always a headache.
1170,"Doest work. Get an error when i try to add my fight, so cant even use a digital ticket. Embarrasing as a canadian."
1172,Flight has been delayed twice. Gate change once. Not one notification.
1173,"Won't load my trips, just keeps saying there's been an error and someone has been notified"
1177,wow! going backwards fast! What was wrong with the old app?
1178,I was not able to access my booking and there were several errors.
1179,Terrible app Keeps crashing. Will not accept flight number.
1180,"Is it possible to award negative stars? It is the most miserable application (and airline) that ever existed. Never, ever again! Don't care how much more it costs to fly with any other airline."
1181,Cannot get it to connect in flight on my samsung note 9..
1183,"Apps still very buggy, can't add existing reservation"
1184,Unable to add flight reservation.
1185,"Terrible, frustrating, aggravating, and worst of all useless"
1186,Newest update didn't work on my most recent flight (Monday). Disappointing considering that part of my fare pays for this non functioning entertainment
1187,"I used this for my boarding pass and it crashed just as I tried to scan in at Security. I couldn't get it to restart. I had to leave the long line that I had waited in and go out to get a paper boarding pass then go through the line again. Later I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it working again. Also, it takes a lot of clicks to find the not so obvious location of the boarding passes. The old app was great. This version is not. Samsung Note 10+"
1188,"What have you done? This app used to be so good. You could do so much, so easily. Now I can't manage many of the things I could before. And to make matters worse, old bookings keep popping up no matter how often I remove them. And trips I enter disappear the next day. Its like they took away features, gave it a new face, and called it new."
1189,"Couldn't book flights to begin with. Finally got through to an agent after several attempts. Then could not check in through the app. No help from agent. We through the website and was able to check in finally. What's the app for then, other than wasting my time. And cost me more money to book my flight because of the delay. Not happy at all"
1190,"How on earth are you supposed to get the app if it's not compatible with your otherwise very useable device? Pity! Everything worked well enough until the upgrade last month. Gotta give Air Canada credit ... I didn't think Rouge could get more difficult and uncomfortable to fly, but sure enough! They managed to make the entertainment inaccessible for all but those lucky enough to have brand new devices."
1191,"The most destructive update yet. Such a discombobulated app now. Can't refresh flight status for updates, and why 3 different panes to get all the info you should get on one??! No gate info on ""Trips"", have to go to ""Flight Status"", no boarding card in either have to go to ""More"". really?? ""More""??! Because that makes sense and it's intuitive. Actually ""Trips"" literally has no useful information at all. All just awkward and non linear. I can't anticipate where to find the info. Roll it back"
1192,poor customer support. app does nothing but showing your booking.
1194,"Totally dislike this app, can't do booking with discount code or do eupgrade or event check in properly. It ended up I had to either use their official website or call the call center which took me a couple of hours just to get things done. I was told that the whole air Canada system changed and it will take times. I hope it won't take too long before I can use the app without difficulty."
1195,"The Air Canada mobile app did not show the full seat plan. I selected a seat which I was under the impression was a window seat, but actually is a middle seat. Air Canada at the airport cannot help me change the seat as the flight is full. Also they cannot upgrade me to Premium Economy because their new reservation system does not support this, although I was willing to pay. How about actually building systems around serving your customers and ensure that these are user tested before launch?"
1196,"This app is horrid. If it was planned to be horrid, well, AC has outdone themselves! Bravo! I tried to book a flight 2x, and got an error code. So, I book it elsewhere. About an hour later, the app advises me I now have THREE bookings for the same flight! I have THREE confirmation numbers. Which means I have now paid 3x.?? Even though the app said the booking was not made and gave me an error code. I will now work on cloning myself."
1197,"This app is completely useless. Prior to the redesign it had some flaws, but all around worked ok and easy to use. Booking were automatically loaded if you booked through flight pass, check-in was easy, all boarding passes were displayed and your main screen was a countdown to your next flight. Now there not even a point of taking space up on your phone with this usless app"
1198,"I entered my trips played around all three, but when i return to app they are not there?"
1199,"Completely frustrated. I wanted to sign up for notifications about the flight my dad was on, and your website told me to download your app to do this. However when I use your app there is no where to request updated about a flight. Why?!? I signed up for an account with you, but because it's not flight it won't let me receive notifications. That's not what your website said... Your app has left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth"
1200,No idea what happened but this app is terrible now. The Air Canada app was pretty good before but sometime in the Oct or Nov 2019 time frame I recieved an update that distroyed it. 75 percent of the time it crashes. It is no longer intuitive to use but the worst part is it is impossible to quickly find and book a flight or check into a flight due the the crashing. I would give it negative stars if I could.
1201,"Edit: 2020-01-11 - new app still terrible. I can login to Aeroplan, but can't login to the new Air Canada using my Aeroplan credentials. It tells me my account is locked out, but Aeroplan is fine. Terrible customer experience, even as a gold member. Thinking of moving to the competition. Awful experience. After discontinuing Mobile+ I can't login to the app. Password reset doesn't work. I can't believe I've been a Gold member for so long with so little support from Air Canada..."
1202,"Buggy, confusing, can't save, freezes, hard to navigate. Just terrible. Trying to get help...phone customer service is nonexistent, and the app often says ""well, this is embarassing..."" this didn't work, we can't tell you why, for how long, and how to fix it. THE WORST."
1203,"Worst! Basic app basic features. Can't even see your booking it change seats, tickets, etc...seriously AC please look at DELTA airlines app that is the best by far!! Literally I was coming to the gate and the delta app told me I was going to miss my connection and gave me options to choose another flight for FREE in the app before I even got out of the chair!"
1204,"Since the update it has been abysmal. Cannot check in through it, the option just doesnt work. If you can still request upgrade or get on standby I cant find it in the app. The old version was infinitely better. This has now just become an information display only. No functionality"
1206,"This is the worst app upgrade I've ever experienced. Log in doesn't work, cannot recall boarding passes, user interface is unacceptable, user experience is a big fat zero. Hey Air Canada, why can't you guys get anything right? Why don't you guys start hiring competent people instead giving in to the union."
1207,"Much worse than previous AC app. Did they do any beta testing before unleashing this on their unsuspecting customers? One example of the many flaws - the Trips screen still show a link to a boarding pass from Dec 11, even though I have taken at least five flights since then. Why not show the most recent boarding pass?"
1208,The old version of the app used to be quite decent but the new update is difficult to use and doesn't work most of the time. Old flight updates stay on the screen and is riddled with errors and technical issues. It's been a few months since the new update and I have not seen any improvements.
1209,Badly implemented. I can pull up my booking online but not on this app. Makes for a very anxious and dissatisfying experience. Air Canada needs to be more transparent and communicative if they want to keep loyal customers. Better customer service training is for sure required.
1210,Not happy at all with the new app. I used to easily download my AC flights even when booked with my travel company and it's not working. I go to Air Canada website and I have no issues. Quite annoying as I like having access to my flights in one place.
1212,"Horrible app. Barely works, even the rudimentary features. Actually does nothing that even makes it worth installing the app. This is not the future. Merely a glimpse at a very rudimentary past. What is astounding is that someone at the software team at Air Canada has actually approved this app for its customers."
1213,"Does air canada even remotely care about their customers? I would never fly this garbage airline if there was any other option. You make an app that is completely useless. It is impossible to check in using the app. Trying countless times was completely fruitless. Eventually had to find a computer browser to log in. And trying to phone for support is impossible. Apparently the new system is causing so many problems, they won't even try to take any calls. Garbage app from a garbage company!"
1215,"Awful, I tried to uninstall and reinstall, still cannot find flights. I just get an error message saying ""oops, this is embarrassing"" . I'm certain A.C. doesn't care as the government will keeps bailing them out as required, but I guess WJ gets my money again."
1216,"New app interface is confusing, first page you see is the booking page, not your pass, flight, info etc. All information were in one page (seats, upgrade, standby, boarding pass, now it's all over the place, hard to find the information you need"
1217,Usless This app is now useless and frustrating - was once good. Will not recognize your flight reservation # - just tells you that's embarrassing. Everything about it makes you want to book with a different airline. Have to use the website not this app to get anything done.
1218,"Not good. Unfortunately, other airline options are limited. The app will not load my upcoming flight. Perhaps it was designed this way to force you to visit check in? The previous app would load my upcoming flights via Aeroplan. Not the case anymore."
1219,"Rouge in-flight entertainment doesn't work. It boots me from the app into Chrome, which helpfully tells me that I need to be in the app to watch anything. Trying to watch something takes me back to the app and then...nothing happens. Not great."
1221,Very good. Easy to get around. Thanks Air Canada!
1222,"Slow, poor format that makes it very hard to navigate. The previous version was much more intuitive and clearly laid out. This one is trying to look pretty but doesn't do a very good job at even that. Air Canada is great but they should consider going back to the old app and making small adjustments to that to fit their new livery and colour scheme."
1223,"Air Canada still doesn't have the app thing figured out. I can't book tickets with a credit card through the app, always declines it, but I have no problem on the website. When using the electronic boarding pass it doesn't show up in time for connecting flights. And the app just won't even load sometimes. The concept of this app is great, they just need to get it all working properly."
1225,I can't even download this app. I've been trying for a week. It kept saying it needed an update. I try to update and nothing happens.... I have no issue downloading or updating any of my other apps. The older version had a better layout and was easier to navigate. I've uninstalled the app and tried to reinstall it. Nothing happening. I fly up to 8 flights a month with Air Canada and this is disruptive to say the least!
1226,"Terrible app. The version prior to the system change was much better and providing much more information and we were able to request upgrades. This one has minimum info, and now does not work."
1227,"Basically nothing important works. Cannot check in, fails to retrieve boarding passes, standby/upgrade lists. Only part that really works is retrieving your flight numbers from a booking reference, which is already in your booking email."
1228,"The app was a complete failure just when I needed it most. Walked up to security to show my boarding pass. The app interface was completely different from yesterday and the boarding passes for my two flights, which I viewed many times yesterday were no where to be found and they could not be retrieved. It looked as if Air Canada had no knowledge of me other than you show me a minimal listing of today's flights. I noted that the app was updated yesterday. I think the update was a complete fail."
1229,"I really wish the old app was still available! I am using Galaxy S10+ and cannot book a flight through the app, everytime I try to select a city it says no results, try another city? I am traveling between Toronto, Vancouver and LAX, these are major cities that were available in the old app. I wouldn't be upset if first time but this has been ongoing since day 1, and I submitted the error on two previous occasions and included screen shots and still no fix, seriously, taking way too long!"
1231,"Wow, just wow. You took a perfectly good application and really messed it up. The 'new' application is a hybrid mobile app that has very limited features compared to the older application which was just fine. Can no longer change seats, look at the seat map on all flights, etc. This is a giant face-palm ???????. Bring back the older and 'functional' app."
1232,The app crashes and require reinstall. Could not check in for a flight operated by Omni on the app. Had to go to the browser to check in on the AC website. The old app was more user friendly.
1234,"This app has terrible glitches! The flight tracking information is incorrect and misleading. Not a reliable source of information. When tracking my flight for today, it referred to yesterday's flight - which was cancelled - making it seem like my flight today was cancelled. Came to the airport to find a new flight only to learn that my flight is as scheduled. (Thank goodness). Would not trust the app for accurate flight details."
1235,"What a horrible update! Trading updated color schemes for greatly decreased functionality makes absolutely no sense. The app is now just a collection of links to websites. Where you used to be able to change seats, bid for upgrades, get your boarding pass, etc these functions now just redirect you to a web browser. Even after the redirect you need to enter your booking number and personal details before using the function. How is this not automatic? Making WestJet look better every day"
1236,"It would not download. I had a previous version of the app, but it required an update in order to use. For some reason the update won't load....so a 6 hour long flight without entertainment. Very annoying. Also it would be helpful if you could let passengers know well before their flight that entertainment is not available. That can't be so difficult eh? Even a pre boarding announcement would help . It was not on my ticket....though I hear that's where you sometimes put in the fine print."
1237,"Updated app: Have had to re-enter same information more than once. Now app keep closing down, so I can't even read the notifications it's sending me. Previous app was much more usable and stable. Poor job on this version."
1238,"The updated app as a serious problem with the lay out of the ""add a flight"" page. The space to enter the reference number is at the bottom of the page. When the auto correct on my screen enages it covers refence number and you can't see the space to complete typing the refence number. It seems like a pretty thoughtless design. Could you move the refence space up the pages, which is larley empty space, so the user can read what they typing."
1239,"What a horrible ""update"". Gone are one click easy checkin based on Aeroplan number and airport of departure, seat previews and selection are nowhere to be found, and you'll now need to carry your status card in a physical wallet as there is no longer an electronic version. Also, it's been quite frustrating having to manually re-add existing bookings - especially given that all suddenly now have new reference numbers. As one of your 100K travelers, AC, I encourage you to rectify this mess ASAP."
1267,"After december 10th update, app will not load. I get an error message now and the app shuts down. nice. I really need this app to work for upcoming flights, this is very frustrating for me, and, I'm guessing many others. Update...the next update fixed the shutdown problem and the app runs much better...thank you for fixing! Bugs were fixed, for sure, no troubles for 6 months or more. Thank you, again for fixing!"
1343,Good app overall. Just don't use auto update on it. It will lose your boarding pass when an update is performed. This happened to me right before boarding last week.
1376,What a garbage app. Doesn't update any information (Gate.. seat ) and it keeps giving me an error when adding the boarding pass. Such an embarrassment
1421,"sorta ok but some procedures aren't intuitive. looks like programmers never 'test drove' this thing. and AC is VERY slow in announcing flight delays & cancellations,lll & equipment & gate changes. WITH DUMB NOV 2019 APP UPDATE CAN ONLY SEARCH FLIGHTS UP TO THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE!!!!"
1422,This new update keeps crashing. Really great news for me as I have a flight in 6 hours and can't retrieve my boarding pass. Well done AC.
1426,App is negligible in quality since update. Used to show gate and relevant info but not anymore. Please consider a valuable update that is beneficial to the user community
1431,"So the new update now deletes my address and credit card number every time. Huge pain. Please fix. Really big fan of bringing the calendar sync option back. Thank you. That really helps with my planning for conference call and also looking back to see which cities I was in on which days. Love to see the calendar info include a little more information like the terminal number, maybe the comments could show the recommended check in times. Good progress."
1672,"After the recent update it had signed me out. Normally that wouldn't be such a big deal, but I am unable to sign back in, I am unable to reset my password, and I am unable to look up my username. I keep getting the same message over and over again saying that ""We are unable to do that at this time."" Thats only been happening since the last update, so something had to have gone wrong and needs to be fixed."
1675,"This update is horrible. It won't remember trips, requiring a confirmation number every single time the app is reopened. Rather defeats the whole convenience of the app if I have to look up the confirmation number and save the boarding pass to photos as a primary document rather than a back up. If there's a gate change, the app doesn't notify, either."
1769,Won't let me check in. I thought the most recent update fixed this but I guess not.
1770,I type in the booking reference and the app crashes. I can't check in. This app experience is reflective of my enter experience with the airline.
1771,"This new App sucks, I am a frequent flyer with AC 75K status, so no one can argument with me reagarding this like I am new to it or etc. The previous app had more options. And this one is just garbage."
1772,Doesn't work... won't find my reservations... hopefully the flight is better
1773,Nov 2019 Unstable app! So many crashes. So hard to get my reservations sync on it and when I dot often it just disappear. Forget to have your boarding passes on it.. also it seems you can't see neither change your seat beside during the check in process
1775,"Error - 1022 We can't search for flights, because of this error, which makes the app useless for me."
1776,"Even if someone hires an app developer and pays him/her 10K to build an worse app than this one, he/she won't be able to. This is useless app. Booking information doesn't show up. It doesn't throw flight status nor alerts. I don't understand why Air Canada keeps this app. Because they have to?"
1777,"11/30/19 Update: This update caused a duplication of all trips in the app. In addition, I can't even check in for a flight. Hey AC...how come your app updates create problems for the user instead of improving the app?"
1778,"OK... I upgraded the rating to 3 stars. To their credit they added the integration that went missing. My original 1 star comment was as follows: Imagine taking a perfectly acceptable app and then ""upgrading"" it by taking away all the integration, automation and intuitiveness."
1779,"Often, it wont recognize my booking reference code. Sometimes the boarding pass doesn't load properly on screen for security to scan. The layout and ability to view past trips and boarding passes is not well thought out."
1780,"Forced to update, then wouldn't let me check in, saying had to see an agent. Used my wife's phone and the old app which thankfully still worked! The old app was great, the new one, garbage! Why change it if your not improving it?"
1781,"Congratulations Air Canada. You managed to make the app worse and call it an upgrade. I guess you need it that way to go hand in hand with your passenger flight experience. Believe me when i say that if there was an option to your airline and app, you would not make the cut."
1783,"For the amount that Air Canada charges, you'd figure they could make an app that works properly and is more intuitive. At a minimum, maybe an app that doesn't boot you off without warning."
1784,Terrible new version. I feel lost looking for my flight. Air Canada go and get your money back from whomever scammed you into developing this. A good damage control measure is to go back to the old one.
1785,"App had Air Canada flight from LHR to YYZ as a United flight, so couldn't check in. Tried phoning, sending messages via Facebook Messenger and DM tweet and no responses. Subsequently missed the flights. Thanks for nothing Air Canada for the appalling customer service and rubbish app!"
1787,This new version is almost unusable. The previous one was super user friendly and had all the information you could possibly need. If it's not broke please don't fix it. The last version I would give 5 stars .
1788,"Where is the Rouge player? What happened to the saved info that auto populates when you check in? Couldn't even check in, had to check in through AC life. This app is glitchy, I liked the old version way better. Fix it guys!"
1789,"This update was not the best. Everything is hard to find now, and not really intuitive. It shouldn't be so hard to find your current active boarding pass - the one thing you really need from the app."
1790,Doesn't recognize reservation codes. Can't see my boarding passes in the app. The previous app was much better.
1792,"Horrible app, can't even login!!!and don't try to call them... even worse!! They don't care about their customers. Fly WestJet"
1793,That did you do to the app? I just opened the app today to check into my flight and the interface is different. I had to enter my booking reference just to find the flight. You should be automating everything for me. How can you go backwards. Oh and your service sucks.
1795,"Have tried repeatedly to enter an existing trip so I can check in. It worked on one phone, but on another it seems impossible. I get a message saying Air Canada is embarrassed. And well it should be!"
1798,Just badly designed. App designers clearly are not users of the app or taken into account how app is used. Finding boarding passes when you have multiple due to frequent flying is next to impossible. AC staff gate staff all apologizing.
1799,"It's nice to see this app keeps getting worked on, but it keeps having problems. Can't even do a simple check in. Doesn't update properly. Still shows old trips with flight being on time. And more"
1800,"New Air Canada app won't allow bookings to be added to it. To be clear, I have to use an external travel app to keep track of my Air Canada bookings because the Air Canada app can't acknowledge bookings from its own airline."
1801,"Air Canada site under Google play is supposed to be updated Nov. 29 to fix any bugs, but after 5 minutes, it was still waiting for update to be downloaded. Why???"
1802,"Used to be ok. Now it's impossible to access my altitude card, which is causing a number of issues at the airport when trying to use my status benefits."
1803,"Used this app the first time to check in and it's not working. Had to use browser instead. After that tried the app again to get boarding passes, and again not working."
1804,Jan.2nd still buggy. At times it refuses to open. Not user friendly at all.
1805,"What a terrible, terrible update. Where's the option to check-in with my Aeroplan number? Why do I now only have the option to check-in with my booking reference?!"
1808,"The game is fun, runs smooth and looks great. For a free mobile game it's terrific. Especially the lack of ads!!! My only real gripe is the controls are frustratingly unresponsive at times, there are a lot of swipe commands that go unnoticed, I thought maybe I need a bigger swipe, but a bigger swipe"
1809,"Beautiful remake of the classic game! I absolutely loved playing Rayman as a kid, and was thrilled to discover that it still exists (though I am bummed that I can't find the original 1950s version). Love the gameplay design, beautiful graphics, and the wonderful music! Rayman is by far one of the best games out there, and they have done an amazing job on this version! If you want a game that is fun and challenging, get this!"
1810,This game is perfect It looks like a compact version of rayman legends It has good controls and good graphic Although it would have been awsome if ubisoft brought more of his good games to mobile PROPERLY(ac identity was awful) For example try to bring prince of Persia back Starting with a good mobile game Well that was it Hope to see better games soon
1811,"Great, but gets boring when all you can to do is try to grab eggs and get out before your adventure ends in an hour. I love games like this, but i lost interest in particularly this one. It could be better"
1812,One fantastic adventure through years. It takes you to a world of joy and dream. The music is fantastic. It suits it dreamy colorful world and the design is astonishing. Creatures are lovely and cute. Game is fantastic although ot sounds simple but it is wonderfully thrilling and enjoable to play. Thanks agsin ubisoft for this great work like you other ones.
1813,"The game is beautiful and imaginative. Unfortunately I didn't adapt to the controls. There should be an alternative control option where you'd move with a pad, touching the screen."
1814,"Could be a good game, basically a dumbed-down version of Rayman Legends. BUT, it crashes and locks up every time an ad plays, which makes it more frustrating than fun."
1815,I am a huge fan of Rayman and so long as you do missions and play the game and fully complete the missions it's easy to get diamonds and tickets. However I would like the channel to work.
1816,"Ever since I was 4 (2013-ish), I have been the biggest Rayman fan ever! I have played every Rayman game there is, especially Rayman Legends, and I used to play this on my moms iPad, so this is just nostalgic to me and Iove it to this day. Besides that, this game is beautifully made and has great music in each level with fun and adventurous gameplay! If I could, I would give it an infinity it's so good. ?"
1817,"Used to be a nice game, moved to a new phone and downloaded.. now I get an error ""download error, please make sure you are connected to internet and try again later"" and no access anymore. After all the progress I made I don't want to have to start from the beginning. Submitted request to fix this to Ubisoft. Got instant acknowledgement of my request but no fix after 2 weeks."
1818,"love the game, a great version of rayman in a side scroller/run adventure game that's fun and challenging right from the start. the only thing I would change is add more control settings."
2172,"After update the app is basically useless. Cant login after 10 tries at their new double verification, called the number they said could fix it, no option for log in assisstance with general wait time between 90 minutes and 2 hours. AC back to their usual standards."
2181,"New AC app is marvellous. Finally the airline got it right. Boarding pass is integrated, tracking flights is easy - bravo!"
2191,App is awful at the best of times. Flying air Canada is always a headache.
2198,I do not like this app. The interface is not so good.The customer care number Is not working.Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ
2203,"Complete junk. Can't even find my bookings. Useless. Shameful. Unacceptable. Bad. Update: a month after its inception it is still not working. I have two international bookings with AC, both of which changed booking numbers in AC's new reservation system. This dumb app can't find either one, under t...
Full Review"
2209,"App doesn't work anymore, very disappointed."
2210,"The worst app I've ever used. I should say tried to use. It won't let me enter a trip to Australia, get a message that can not process request when I enter same booking info as online web site. Garbage. Shameful. If a Zero score was available I would have given the app zero. Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡"
2221,"Wow, just wow. You took a perfectly good application and really messed it up. The 'new' application is a hybrid mobile app that has very limited features compared to the older application which was just fine. Can no longer change seats, look at the seat map on all flights, etc. This is a giant face-palm Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¦Ã°ÂÂÂ¿Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¸Â. Bring back the older and 'functional' app."
2224,"What a horrible update! Trading updated color schemes for greatly decreased functionality makes absolutely no sense. The app is now just a collection of links to websites. Where you used to be able to change seats, bid for upgrades, get your boarding pass, etc these functions now just redirect you to a web browser. Even after the redirect you need to enter your booking number and personal details before using the function. How is this not automatic? Making WestJet look better every day."
2231,"Hard to say if it's the app or the brand. But the only use for this app is flight status notifications. I have never been able to access my boarding pass, change flight, even check in for my flight, etc. (Basically anything you expect an airline app to do, this only does flight notifications.) Then you have to download the aeroplan app for the ""loyalty program."" And that one is just as convenient...yea, no. Not at all."
2236,"Terrible update - did not migrate all my reservations, made an error in the spelling of my name, and found errors in the personal / family data that was migrated (check yours to make sure!). To end it, the app updated itself on my phone without my knowing it - no permissions asked. AC, as a million miler and someone who gave feedback about the beta version, I expected more from the airline I use most! You could have done a better job."
2237,"The latest update is terrible. First of all it simply removed all my bookings from the list. On top of that , after adding them again they simply disappear every time the app is opened. As a developer I can't understand what's the problem with persisting data or properly retrieving it from a remote source. Also, the location for checking in and finding boarding passes is not intuitive as they're separate and not linked to the reservation. Yes the UI has a better looking but not useful."
2238,"Air Canada, you have outdone yourselves again! It is amazing how you were able to surprise your users with a new and much worst app that prevents travelers from doing basic things like check-in or storing boarding passes. Wow, the latest update made it a pure garbage. Now I have to go back to the early 2000 and check in on a PC and print my passes"
2239,I dunno that I've had a more frustrating experience with any app ever prior to using this one. Can't find a booking reference. Can't login to Aeroplan. The check-in process just links to the browser method. It's super aggravating to even try and use. Just check in via the browser and take a screenshot of the boarding pass - skip the app altogether.
2242,"THIS APP IS AWFUL AFTER UPDATE!!! I always use this app to travel back and fourth from toronto to vegas. It functioned fine before the update and now this app takes forever to load. I cant book anything on here because it doesnt load. Also, flight status... i can only check out to 4 days? Are you kidding me? Not even a week, 7 days? Please fix. Im going to just go on google flights to check status or use perhaps your desktop site instead b/c this app is now trash."
2243,"Just when you thought this app couldn't get any worse... And here comes a new, updated version that is a forced update. It won't carry your bookings over so make sure you have all your info ahead of time. It also won't retrieve bookings based on your aeroplan number, so you'll have to put them all in again manually. App is extremely delayed while refreshing internet data."
2244,"There was no reason for AC to develop an app that undid 90% of the functionality of the previous app. This app does not retain booked reservations, does not show detailed flight data such as standby/upgrade lists, and requires multiple clicks to execute basic functions like check in. As a Super Elite Million Mile member, and also a former consultant to Air Canada, I am intimately familiar with the recent PSS upgrade. None of that required a wholesale butchering of the previous app."
2245,"This should be a case study around the world, how in 2019, after more than 100 million apps were made for smart phones, comes this shocking failure of an app. Nothing works. Doesn't pull in my flights and most of the times does not find my bookings based on the reservation number. It is an absolutely disastrous waste of space"
2246,"I would hope the developers have taken note of the comments and challenges with the new version of the AC app. In case it's not clear to everyone, you went from a world-leading, asolutely kick-ass app to a place of mediocrity. Since we can't book or seach for flights anymore with the new app, pehaps a scrum or two need to address the fact that you've moved backward by at least 3 years. Perhaps it's Android only but I doubt it. Get to work and we hope to see a new version RSN. Good luck."
2254,Not impressed The old app was 1000 percent better. Logged in knew it was me brought up my flights. This one I need to input that info. Also doesn't allow me options like the one it replaced. Very disappointed. Tried logging I to their web site today on my computer and it would not connect. Tried the old phone method and no one to answer!! Problems galore all around.
2255,"Terrible re-design of app. Can't easily find boarding passes. They are under ""more"" not ""my trips"" tab. Alaska Airlines app let's you select earlier or later flights during check in, this doesn't. Doesn't send notifications, and always get confused between logging in with Air Canada credentials or Aeroplan. Old Air Canada user interface was pretty good, this new stuff is garbage."
2256,"I am a 100k Super Elite, and I cannot check-in using mobile after their upgrade (either system or app no longer works). Once checked-in, I cannot get eticket to show so now I have to ask for a paper copy. I assume this means eUpgrades will also be less usable through check-in screen. The saving grace for AC is their staff at check-in and lounges- as it certainly is not their mobile team. The UX (when it almost worked) was less functional, but did look prettier than previous version- design>ux"
2257,Would give the new app zero stars if possible. It lost all my bookings. I have to input my credit card and billing info every time as it can't seem to remember anything. Searching for flights and finding your boarding pass (which doesn't auto-brighten your screen anymore either) have become less intuitive. Funnies part is you can't even book a flight without getting an error message on this dogshit app. A real shame as the old app was much better than the westjet app.
2258,"I have not been able to retrieve my bookings or check in to my flights successfully once since the new version of the app rolled out. I exclusively use Flight Passes and it won't even pull in my bookings or recognize them when trying to add them manually. Also, removing the ability to check in with Aeroplan number and hiding the link to check in from the main screen makes this app unusable. I wish it worked as well as the dedicated Flight Pass app."
2259,"This app is completely useless. Prior to the redesign it had some flaws, but all around worked ok and easy to use. Booking were automatically loaded if you booked through flight pass, check-in was easy, all boarding passes were displayed and your main screen was a countdown to your next flight. Now there not even a point of taking space up on your phone with this usless app."
2265,"This app was fine before, did what it had to do. BUT THIS NEW UPDATE IS TERRIBLE.. it completely removed all my flights from my account, it wont let me check in to my upcoming flight-even though its less than 24 hours from now. There is no longer a home page and so it makes the app more difficult to navigate. Many other little issues i noticed and i am very unimpressed."
2266,"Worst airline app I have ever worked with, I constantly get error messages when I try to book flights without any explanation, only explanation is ""it is too embarrassing!"" at least they got this right! For a company like Air Canada this app is really embarrassing! You can't even book flights on it."
2268,"On a pixel 3 using android 10 - since the new release nothing is working. 1. Tried to check in my flight from yul to YYZ this evening, when choosing the standby early option none of the options responds 2. Tried over 10 times during various time to check in my flight, on the last screen when issuing the boarding pass got the ""something went wrong"" error message. Ended up using the web portal instead"
2270,"Absolutely terrible update, had to manually enter all personal information again. nothing was transferred over. Unable to book new flights because the updated mobile number from the Aeroplan app doesn't syncing into my passenger information on the application. Why would this be allowed to go into production without proper testing?"
2271,"Why does the new app have less information on my flight than the old one? It is no longer very intuitive in terms of seat selection, upgrade bids etc. Clicking change takes me to the site which doesnt work because my flight is booked through an agent... if I have to go to your site what is the point of this app?"
2272,"What happened? Previous app was fine - had links to other Air Canada services, kept all my bookings, etc. Now it's causing me to start all over again but it won't maintain my bookings. And no more handy links, or working on seat selection. Feels like I've stepped back into the dark ages."
2273,Ok...been a month or so since using this app and looks air canada has tried to upgrade it......b4 it would work intermittently now not at all...I put in by ref # and last name over the last 12 hours multiple times and get an error each and every time...say it is reported but never work! I guess it is back to kiosk (which worked fine. This is very frustrating for this day and age.
2277,"Very basic. Has airport maps of airports that i dont need but dont list the ones that i do. Removed contact info for customer service. As a 50K, has no indication of status or benefits. No links to anything,. Not even a home screen. This was a BIG step backwards and a BIG disappointment Ã°ÂÂÂ¥ Air canada should look at Delta's app. One star because i cant give any lower. Typical air Canada- give less but charge more."
2279,"Doesn't keep my bookings...each time I restart the app, it looses my bookings and my Aeroplan number, app doesn't retrieve my bookings even when logged in with Aeroplan number, cannot see seats, nor the layover time, nor the details of the flights anymore, cannot book a flight anymore, cannot makes changes to flights, cannot check in, cannot...cannot... cannot...name anything, this app can't do it! What's the point? Even RyanAir and EasyJet have better apps that this...."
2281,"Since the update it has been abysmal. Cannot check in through it, the option just doesnt work. If you can still request upgrade or get on standby I cant find it in the app. The old version was infinitely better. This has now just become an information display only. No functionality."
2283,The company is less responcive than the app. Despite this being a challenging time Air China refunded tickets immediately. Manulife refunded a one year travel policy after 5 minutes on the phone. Getting a personal responce out of Air Canada is like trying to squeeze water out of a rock. They do not pesonally respond to email. Phone.... You'll spend 1/2 hour on hold only to have the call drop. If you can get thru mention the DOT Enforcement Notice which obligates them to issue refunds.
2284,"Old app - Buggy... check-in hit and miss... doesn't link well with Aeroplan or give me access to a digital Altitude card. Really one of the worst airline apps, needs work. Updated app - UI is now worse, just horrible, even trying to view or retrieve a booking is confusing. Check-in doesn't work, and boarding passes not stored in app either, so what is the point of this app? This is a non native app that is a jumble of web links. App in current form is useless."
2285,"Horrible update to the AC app! I can't book a one way flight from a non-local destination, all my info is gone, you can't preview seats, and you can't review different dates for flex travel options.... what is the point of this update!?!?! And just before the holiday season! Really!?!?!??!?!"
2286,"The new app is terrrrrible. Can we just have the old one back please? All of my bookings are duplicated consistently, I can't read them because if I scroll down the app decides to push be back to the top of the list so it can refresh in an infinite loop. Used/past boarding passes also stay around for weeks after the flight."
2287,I used this app weekly for weeks fornwork travels. Last major in November 2019 made it absolutely awful. Its. Now impossible to retrieve booking using you frequent flyer number and old Old boarding pass from Previous trips are showing up before new One. Also Unable to find having a hard time to retrieve booking using air Canada booking number. They took and okay app and made it absolutely frustrating.
2288,"Air Canada really messed up. This app is the worst I've seen, previous app was not perfect but at least it worked, this one doesnt do anything. Reservations never appear, nither boarding passes, check in takes for ever, and if you add that is imposible to get a hold of an agent, I have to say Air Canada is really deception."
2291,"Useless app. The on board wifi wouldn't connect. The both times I tried checking in the night before my flight, it said I checked in successfully, but the morning of my flight when I checked the app for the flight status, it said I had not checked in, on both flights there and return. Totally useless app."
2293,"Everytime we try to use it there's a problem. Never had a successful check-in. Always get an error, luggage payment went through but it says 0 luggage on the app, etc..."
2300,"Very bad experience. Booked seats and printed boarding pass but those weren't available and they refused to honour my boarding pass, instead printing me a new one. Also, having to enter over and over again the same booking #, to check-in, then change seats, then track flight, then track your trip... wth. On top of that, it changes things like booking # without telling you why, nor offering an wasy/quick way to contact Customer Support. Poor FAQ / knlwdge base included. Horrendous."
2301,"Nicer UI for the app but missing lots of critical info from the old app. Eg. Digital Altitude Status card, Seat Preview, no images of beautiful destinations, limited tracking of future flights, no ability to do eupgrades on the app. Overall, they made it look nicer but completely neutered the functionality."
2307,Almost missed my flight and caused a lot of stress. I checked in the morning of the flight and had my boarding pass just on the app. Then I was right about to start going into security and the app told me to update. All my info and my boarding pass was gone. I thought it would have my boarding pass linked to my aeroplan account at least but nothing. Horrible experience.
2309,The previous app was largely better. 30 minutes from boarding this app still doesn't show the actual gate for the flight. Was unable to check in from app as kept saying that booking number didn't exist even if booking is saved in app. Had to redo process 3 times to get electronic boarding passes on here.
2312,"What's the point? Should be all about the traveler. If you login you should see your status, booked flights and the ability to manage your flights and account. This app does none of this. Have a look at the Delta app if you want to know how an airline app should work."
2313,"Garbage. The app does not show your altitude status anymore. Slow to respond. No more biometric log in option. Minimal information about your upcoming flights, unable to see or change your seat. List can go on but lost enough time on this useless ""upgrade""."
2315,"It takes a ridiculously long time to pull up flight prices. The only reason it should take that long is if you were kayak and searching every airline. On top of that, the itinerary has next to no information, and no option to select seats or anything."
2317,"This latest update stripped all useful functionally and now all it does is show me the dates that I'm flying. I can't check my seat, booking class, upgrade options, or really anything other than view date and time of flight. Please go back to the previous version."
2320,"Awful update. The app was quite functional before but now it is slow, unresponsive, and my trips had disappeared. Also the boarding pass doesn't appear after you check in using the web version (which I had to as the app kept falling to allow me to check in)."
2321,"The old add works perfect, but the new one has a lot to complain. The app becomes not as fluent as before. Information on baggage allowance and custom clearance are gone, which were features I appreciate a lot. Hope you can add those features back."
2322,"Horrible app. This ""improved"" app doesn't save your information, and you have to manually add your flights as opposed to the previous app,which would load everything for you. Too bad there isn't a way to go back to the old version. This one is really bad"
2324,"What a disappointment this update is! Who ever thought this was a new and improved version obviously needs to reevaluate. Like many other users, I found the previous version so much easier to navigate and user friendly. I wish there was a way to roll back to the previous version."
2327,Never starts after the last update. And now it's not compatible with my device running Android 6.
2329,New app was automatically added to phone. Old app gone! This one is horrible. It has taken away much of the information that I used to get with old app. Not sure what exactly is supposed to be so new and improved! This one is pretty useless
2330,"Kicks you out for no reason. Hard to check in. Hard to get the information you need. Rather speak with an actual person. But hard to get a hold of someone on the phone as well. ONLY reason to use this is if you bought air canada ticket, other than that, garbage app."
2332,Old app was better. It was glitchy but at least functional! Can no longer access digital card for status. Not able to manage reservations through the app. Basically useless. I was on the beta test for the app but not once was I asked for my opinion.
2333,"The app is a mess compared to the previous version. Won't add bookings that have been made outside of Air Canada's website to my trips, keeps my old boarding passes and trips unnecessarily, makes everything hard to find. Completely terrible user experience."
2335,"Terrible so far..can't see seat selection, more than one flight showed up for the same say, apparently this means the original flight was cancelled and changed but doesnt actually tell you that, and doesnt show what you paid etc.. now have to call and find out whats going on...so far, not a good app at all Ã¢ÂÂ¹"
2339,"What a horrible update this is. Just shockingly bad. The interface isn't intuitive, the background is depressing and they've taken out the seating details. They should pull it and go back to the old one which was great."
2340,"Bad bad bad... Got the app before leaving on trip so I can manage the booking. Before returning I want to check the booking but can't because the app now needs an upd that is forced down my throat as I can't use it before I upd. Also, will lose the booking as it's not transferred so I'll have to go back to find the emails. No way out so I update; now I'm trying to add the booking again in the new app but can't because AC has a problem and they're sorry about it. Did you people test this? Sigh..."
2341,"What did you do this app in the last update? It no longer links to my AC account so I have to put in flights manually, the user interface is terrible, and it has less info than the previous version of the app. At this point, the all is pretty much useless."
2372,"Nice UI. Shame there's even less utility than the previous version. Frequently doesn't work, crashes and generally not up to the basic standards you'd expect of an airline app."
2376,Detailed eady to use accurate
2378,"The app has half the functionality of the old one! Can't see my Aeroplan Status in the app, can't track inbound aircraft, my bookings keep disappearing from the app. AC you need to step up your game"
2380,They made a mess out of this app on the last update. It's no longer intuitive and user friendly. Takes far too much searching and linking compared with previous version.
2381,"This app looks like and performs like it was developed by a three year old built it when the y picked up a computer for the first time. No wait, i am being far too gracious. I cant find half the functions present in the old app. Are they gone?"
2382,Not sure what happened here. New app seems to put some hipster design over functionality. Probably worst airline app on the planet at the moment. And they're surprised by the increased number of calls to their unreachable call center.
2383,"The new app is terrible. The previous version was far superior in look, feel, user experience, functuonality. The new app has less features, less information and is not as intuitive to use"
2387,"The bad: can't use it for check-in, can't get a mobile boarding pass, can't look up a reservation. The good: it gives you the sweating smile emoji while it fails at the most basic of tasks."
2388,Had to stand in line to verify myself before boarding because I used the app. Defeats the purpose if it is more work to use the app. Stick with a paper boarding pass.
2389,"Simply does not work. Will not allow check-in for most US AC flights. Also terrible layout and design. Utter failure as an app. Makes the old version look good, which is tough!"
2390,Can't look up upcoming trips on this app. It just returns errors and tells me to try again later.
2393,This new version has stripped practically all of the functionality of the previous app. So I give this a very poor rating. Also tried to access Airplan and that function not working.
2394,"Doesn't work for check-in, has issues in validating foreign phones, throws error when validating ETA. The only thing that works is information that yes, I booked a flight with air Canada..."
2396,"Very disappointing that none of my information, flights, aeroplanes number etc made it through the upgrade. I loaded my information and checked in. No boarding pass. Can we have the old app back until this one us ready?"
2397,Forced update without giving me a chance to copy my bookings which were erased as a part of the update. Now having spent 2 days trying to get through to recover to lost info. Will never depend on this lousy app again.
2398,"Can't even book a flight with this new update, tried clearing cache and re-installing, nothing worked. I had to resort to use their ""moble optimized"" website to book my flights. Big fail."
2399,AC managed to achieve the seemingly impossible: make a truly horrible app even more useless. Nothing works in this new version. One star is too generous.
2400,"The new update removed the function to manage booking. It becomes useless until the time you check in through the app, of course only if the boarding pass still exists."
2401,"App still shows a boarding pass for a flight I took three days ago. Doesn't automatically show bookings made with my account, have to manually add them. Not intuitive."
2402,"Crashes every time, won't let me see my boarding pass, won't let me tap on most content in the app. Quite frustrating, and not a good first time expirence with Air Canada."
2404,"very basic functions, not integrated with altitude, etc...and nothing works. Between this down grade to the app and recent changes to the AC reservation system...impossible to manage your travel"
2406,"The old version you can add flights and tracking ahead of time now it's not available. And now you can only link profile with aeroplane, this app is going backwards."
2407,"Nothing but problems since redesign. This app was once useful, but since it was revamped, it doesn't work. Please go back to the old version."
2408,The new app is less usable than the old one. That you require a booking reference number to check in is unnecessarily clunky and makes for very poor user experience.
2409,Terrible. Does not keep credit card info. Times out. Not intuitive. How about some AI...and it erased all my upcoming trips... can't check in ahead of time...
2410,"Update seems to be not in the best shape.....first, it deleted all my.flighta fron previous version. Second, I am unable to add it i to the application now ('error we didnt't quite expect)."
2411,"After the updates, the app wont allow me to add any bookings nor my aeroplans. Not even allowed me to search flight status or flights. Kept popping up an message saying unexpected error. Please fix."
2412,"Poor, older version was much better. I can see all my booking details including reference, seat numbers which is not available in the updated app."
2413,"When I try to login to the app using my Aeroplan details, it results in login failure, and it's been more than a month since this app rolled out."
2415,"This isn't just the worst update I've seen in an airline app, it's the worst I've seen in an Android app. How the hell do I check in? It makes me open a separate web browser now. Then give some errors"
2416,"2019-11-29 Still needs lots of work. Could not check in on the app. Had to use the Web and even then, flight does not appear in the app."
2417,"Flights are constantly delayed without compensation. App does not retrieve bookings, and emails to check in are inconsistant. Can not do early check in through website. Terrible application!"
2418,"This app is a step back from the old app. Everything is good seen, it's not easy to check in anymore .. keeps shutting down on me. Bring back the old app !!!"
2419,Good app which updates news constantly
2420,Nov 2019 version of app always crashes when trying to add reservations. Unstable. Do not use for boarding passes. Not sure if it will work for IFE (needed for Rouge)
2422,A total mess...needs a complete overhaul ...this merging of apps with Aeroplan is a disaster...and I am constantly getting messages to change my password because my previous ones dont work
2423,"I cannot seem to find a way to book a 3 city trip. I've tried all the obvious buttons. I can get a one-way trip and I can get a return trip but no obvious way to go from ""city"" A to B and return from C back to A."
2424,"This new version is a disaster. Far less intuitive to use than the old version and less functionality available. What a dissapointment, Air Canada!"
2426,The new app displays too much private information without permission once click on aeroplane tab. It is no good. Actually the old interface was better.
2427,App was great in old format. Every ref number i enter i get sorry error occured. So i can t load any bookings. What a useless app and clearly less functionality. I hope they update asap
2428,"New app update is terrible. It always crashes, does not notify me when I can check-in, and won't let me access my boarding pass."
2429,"This app is a downgrade from the previous version. No integration to aeroplan for flights. No settings to put in default check in data..basically a ""pig with lipstick"""
2431,"Too many bugs, some days it works good, others it doesn't. Today searching flight status by route doesn't work."
2434,"App will crash now as soon as you touch any buttons, old version worked great but new version will crash. Search bars show no results regardless of what you type in."
2435,"Terrible. It worked way better & a lot faster before! I hoped the update on 11/22 would improve it, but it didn't. Please fix it!"
2439,"Worst most flawed app ever. Everywhere you turn, theres an error message patiently waiting for you. Embarrassing"
2440,Very low functionality. Very little information compared to the old one. Needs a lot of work. I will have a hard ti.e using this.
2441,unhelpful app; it never keeps my trips. I'm always having to add my booking info to pull it up. I'd rather use the website on my phone at this point
2442,terrible layout and doesn't show a timer until next flight leaves and arrives like the old app. wouldn't let me pick preferred seats while checking out either for some reason.
2443,"Less functionality than previous app, can't select flights, can't standby for earlier flight, in general very watered down app from previous version. AC do better"
2444,"The update completely killed the app . Stupid Air Canada, no checking if anything web related as usual! Won't find booked flights, keeps asking to update every time also."
2447,The new app has terrible UX. Why are boarding passes hidden under the three-dot menu? It's a core feature of the app. The previous version was waaaaay better.
2448,The new app UI is really horrible. Plus updating removed all of your information. Not sure why they bothered with this update. I'm sure some VP of SW is happy though.
2449,"This app is now horrible. I have bookings appearing in duplicate, cant see or change my seats, cant see if i am wailisted for an upgrade and cant check in. Garbage. Put the old app back."
2450,"I wish i could rate this lower! simply doesnt work, removed features, difficult to use. Was this done as a highschool project?. No im wrong they would have done a much better job. Shamefull effort!"
2451,"Truly hopeless update... Why kill a good thing? Loads random boarding passes unrelated to where you are actually traveling that day. Doesn't automatically open up SMS based boarding passes, etc. Maybe a little prettier, but functionally useless."
2452,"So the player just didn't work on my flight today. So lets recap, I was stuck on a dirty plane with no leg room and the on-board entertainment didn't work. Amazing."
2453,"No digital cards for any level of status P25K to SE100K. Especially for P25K who are not issues plastic cards, this removes the only source of proof of status for Air Canada Altitude members."
2456,"I want to go and explain everything thats wrong with the upgrade but we only have 500 characters on here. Where the hell was QA on this one ??, Can you honestly as Canada's leading Airline afford these kinds of mistakes?"
2457,Updated version no longer has the ability to check in via aeriplan number. You need the booking reference. Inconvenient!
2458,"Literally is useless now. Worked fine a month or two ago, this new update makes it nonfunctional. Cheers, Air Canada, cheers."
2459,Brutal update. Use to be able to check in with Aeroplan number now only option is booking reference....why would that change be made?
2460,Not good. I managed to check in but everytime I try to see my boarding pass it crashes. What is the point in having an app if it cant be used?
2461,It's nice and good. Working better than previous app but it's missing some features (like managing my booking!) and also missing option to import boarding pass into Google pay.
2462,"Nothing works after an upgrade to a new version, cannot add trips, check in, etc. This was a downgrade to totally unusable app."
2463,"Lost all my information, won't retrieve my flights, just doesn't work. Useless upgrade. Bring back the old app.!"
2464,Terrible. It doesn't recognise Air Canada booking references. The interface for booking flights is a slow and painfull process.
2467,"This app is completely useless. It would be better if it wasn't available at all. At least people wouldn't waste their time trying it. Air Canada, please look at Fly Delta app for example, maybe you should banchmark it."
2469,Your new interface is absolutely awful. It doesn't show nearly as much information as the previous version. Please change it back.
2470,Terrible update. Doesn't have stored CC info. Can't book multi-city flights. Better bring back functionality or no chance anyone will keep using.
2471,The old app seemed more accessible. Check-in needs to be on the bottom menu rather than stuffed in the ... menu.
2472,Seems lately not working like it should. I cant sign in anymore without an aeroplan number even though i have an accoint and been using this app for years. Oh well
2473,"Right now, the app won't let me add a booked trip. It returns an error message when I try to input my booking reference."
2474,Can't be any worse than this! Can't add my trips. Can't get boarding pass. Why to have an app if you can't even do the essentials.
2476,"last update in November caused more issues, I could not see any of my 3 booked flights with the Booking references! bad update!"
2477,"Useless info in the ""Whats New"" . . . ""We've fixed a few critical bugs"" . . . You REALLY can't give ANY details on what specifically has been changed/fixed ???"
2478,"Forced updated, now i can't add bookings to the app. And can't connect Aeroplan either, app is as unreliable as the airline itself."
2479,This app has become unusable after the November 15 release. I can no longer find my bookings or any of my trips. Whoever thought this was a GA ready release should be fired.
2480,"Made a reasonably working app worse in the refresh. Appears to be little debugging or testing. ""Just ship it now and we'll patch it later!"". Pathetic."
2481,This app is sorely lacking. Can't see or change seat selection. Less options than previous versions.
2482,Not great. Randomly loses your boarding pass immediately before your flight if your flight has been delayed. Ã°ÂÂÂ
2483,Latest update is terrible. Very difficult to simply find your boarding pass. Often gives me boarding pass of old expired flights...
2489,"Horrible app, didn't think they could make it possibly worse. Completely non-user friendly. Can't find flight information or seat assignment."
2490,The latest update broke access for me on my galaxy s9. My bookings disappeared and I get 'system unavailable ' errors if I try to reload them.
2491,"Horrible app. The previous version was much better. I have yet to successfully check in. Step it up, air Canada..."
2492,"Broken update, cannot retrieve bookings, even after trying to manually retrieve it. Useless in its current state."
2493,"Completely useless app since the update, I've flown multiple times since then and not once have I been able to check in on the app."
2494,"Terrible, this new app is aweful. And to add to the terrible experience air Canada is updating its booking system or something and is completely useless."
2495,The latest upgrade removed my existing reservations and cannot locate them again with booking reference. So I cannot check in or monitor status.
2496,It keeps forgetting my trips! I have added them 3 times and every time I go to the app it says no upcoming trip. How did this app pass QAÃ°ÂÂ¤Â¦?
2497,"The new updated app doesn't work. Almost every option to view any flights status or check in has a ""oops"" error"
2498,Not informative at all. Cannot check into my flight. Just bumps me out and gives an uninformative error message.
2501,I can't use my aeroplan # to identify myself to check in anymore. That's very inconvenient to have to find my booking number...
2502,Continually deletes reservations after they've already been added and the online check in feature doesn't seems to ever work the first time.
2503,Does not work properly It crashes when you try to get your bording pass. Too many steps to verify flights compared to previous app
2505,As a Star Allegiance partner passenger this app is very limited. Logging in as a basically a guest provides very little value.
2506,Constant errors. Can't check-in nor get bording passes. This is a step backwards.
2508,cant even pull up for booking. keep getting a pop up that says an error happened and they have been notified...
2509,Doesn't work. Got boarding pass on 1 of 5 flights. Let's put the old one back up until this one works...
2510,Thank you for updating something that was working perfectly. Now it is not able to find my booking. Mille merci estit
2511,Horrible update... right in the middle of my trip. All my flights and boarding passes disappeared ! User interface sucks
2512,No flight update info or even gate info. Bad navigation. They need to go back to the old app.
2513,"Big step backwards, why can't I see my seat selection anymore? Not intuitive at all."
2514,"Unintuitive menus. The app keeps giving me an error ""well that's embarrassing..."" when I try to check in."
2515,"It's absolutly rediculous that you've taken a half decent app, with just a few glitches and created a completely useless experiement in passanger/customer frustration! Why? Who thought this was a good idea? Are things really this bad and disorangized at Air Canada?"
2518,"AC removed so many functionalities (seat selection, Aeroplan card,...). App is now just completely useless."
2519,Terrible app! Just like the service it's just very disappointing. Since the upgrade it's has gone from bad to worse.
2521,"Why did you change the app? This new version is terrible. It's not well organized, constantly shuts down and not at all intuitive. HATE IT."
2523,"The app is garbage, never works, can't check in for flights. Where are the boarding passes?? Hidden about 3 pages deep."
2524,Crashes all the time
2525,"Never lets me check in through the app. Every time I've used it it says ""An error occured that we didn't expect"""
2526,"Brand new galaxy s10. Wifi says it isn't supported. Have 4 galaxy devices all less than 1 year old, nothing works. Piece of garbage. Horrible. I really want to swear, but I don't do that. My kids can't watch anything."
2527,Still getting error message when I try log my details. I updated it as per the update available on the 21st to no avail.
2528,"New app, same issues. Slow when checking in and God forbid you click twice on something, instant error"
2529,The old app seems better. I find searching for flights more difficult than it should be
2530,"If it's not useless , then it's completely useless. Google provides better tracking than air Canada app itself"
2532,"Waaah, new version is really hard to navigate. Why change the interface? Makes no sense at all."
2533,Very slow and not intuitive to navigate. Poorly designed.
2534,Can't do anything in the app without getting an error message. Absolutely useless.
2535,Same experience with the rest. The new app definitely lost its functionality. Its rather useless now. Whoever designed this or better yet whoever approved this should rethink their decision.
2537,"Updated app is still terrible. Can't check in, can't access boarding passes."
2538,"What a crappy app. Very few features, mostly a sales tool as opposed to a customer service focused app. Waste of time."
2539,"This app is terrible. I couldn't check in, it can't download my pass. I don't know what this is even for if those things don't work."
2540,"This app is not accepting new bookings, keeps crashing after the latest upgrade."
2541,I liked the old app. I use the AC app a lot but don't find this version good at all!!
2542,"The app went from barely useful to hot garbage. Cant even add any bookings because it just throws an error, ffs...."
2543,"Most functions i tried did not work. To be expected from Air Canada, I suppose."
2544,the old app enabled you to select or change seats. wth happened to that??? whoever the developers are for this app are not competent and dumb. they should be fired for such a poorly redesigned app
2545,This update made the app worse and continually crash - please fix. I need to fly tomorrow and can't tell if I'm checked in or not!!
2546,"Very buggy and reduced functionality since the update, better to just use the website now."
2548,"This app is horrible confirmed flights can't be found, at least the this is embarrassing message is something they think is funny Ã°ÂÂÂ"
2550,Can't get my boarding passes . Tried the app for about a week . I get an error with a smily
2551,The new AC app is horrible. Only a fraction of the functionality as before.
2552,Terrible! Aircraft types are incorrect on reservation. Can't load seat map.
2553,The app was very simple before. Now its overly complex.
2554,Terrible. Bookings aren't saved after I add them. No Home page.
2555,Much prefered the older version. This update isn't as user friendly and won't work on my phone.
2556,Doesn't actually allow you to check in. Always errors same issue after multiple flights.
2557,What did you do to your app? The new one is terrible. It keeps forgetting my trips. I add my trips and it removes them after a while.
2558,Haha - Air Canada turned an 'okay' app into a pile of poop. Great work!
2559,"The redesigned app is horribly unusable. On my recent trip, I ended up using Kayak instead. Whomever approved this UX should be fired."
2560,doesn't work. old app was just ok at best. this one did not work from the get go
2561,"New update removed my bookings, am unable to re add them, and now the app won't even update."
2562,This use to be a great app bot sure what you did but fix it! This is the worst airline app out there now by a mile
2563,This app in the recent update has all of a sudden become very unstable.
2564,Disaster. Utterly useless. Can't even handle manually loading a reservation.
2565,"Terrible App.Must use this APP for flight notification, NOT available to do flight notification on PC as before."
2567,Why do I suddenly need my reservation code instead of my Aeroplan number to check in????
2569,Next to useless. Provides you with very little information. The previous versions were 5X more useful. The developers should be sacked.
2570,Very bad since I downloaded the new version its working only Eror messages is popping up all the time
2571,This app was great on my tablet and now does not work at all. We don't all use our tiny phones for apps!
2572,"Terrible Terrible who on earth approved this app change? I mean some idiot thought of the changes and another idiot higher up approved it. It is a useless new version and keeps crashing anyway. I removed mine until new version comes out, totally useless."
2573,Fix this garbage. All tracked trips dissapear when you log into aeroplan on the app.
2574,"After recent December update, the app kept closing when trying to open."
2577,Can't add trips can't check in can't add boarding passes Air Canada needs to fix
2580,Since I have gotten the app I have been unable to look up my flight reservation due to some error with the app
2582,So far I am finding navigation to be horrible and can't get my boarding pass to load. I had to resort to a web check in.
2583,Very difficult to use and check in doesnt always work
2584,Can't check in. Can't login aeroplan. Basically can't use it.
2585,New app crashes and wont let me add flights or view boarding passes ...
2586,The recent update or so called system migration can be adequately described as from bad to worse...
2587,Last update lost every booking and previous boarding pass.
2589,Useless POS app. Waste of time payment for baggage hung. Hope their planes are better. 1.9 stars. Way to go air Canada development team...Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂ¤Âª
2591,"Can retrieve booking, can't check in. All happen after the update...."
2592,Doesn't let check-in and won't generate boarding passes
2593,Nothing works! Cant check in and get boarding pass!
2594,Liked the old app...doesn't indicate seat or upgrades/waiting list
2595,Unable to put flight reference number in. Keeps saying issue.
2597,Very not user friendly. No details on trip at all.
2599,cant successfully checkin. Bring back the old app!!!
2600,It just doesn't work on Android. But they still charged my credit card.
2602,Soooooo many glitches and dont know why it consume so much battery in background apps....
2603,Update is actually worse. Where are my trips? Why is the app so slow? Why can't I switch to USD?
2604,"Brutally bad. WestJet can write a great app, why can't Air Canada??"
2605,"Can't book flights, keeps all old boarding passes"
2606,Not ready for production. Keeps crashing CONTINUOUSLY to the point of being unusable.
2607,November 2019 version I'm unable to see my reservation and it's not responding when I'm re-inputting my reservation.
2608,"Please bring back the old app until the new one works. I can't give zero stars, but that is what the new app deserves."
2609,Soon as I try login in with my areo plan it automatically logs me back out....
2610,New update is absolute garbage if could put nagative star I would. Even with 2 hrs to flight wont let check in. Need old version back
2611,The old app was far more useful and easy to use- this new app is limited and not as useful
2612,"This is what your tech people ""upgraded"" the app too? The previous version was decent what a joke this upgrade is. Have you guys heard of testers?"
2613,Totally useless. Can't even access my boarding pass.
2614,I nearly missed my flight. Gate change did not update on android app. HAD TO RUN TO GATE AFTER INQUIRY W/ GATE AGENT. Guys do not download this app!
2617,Congrats. It takes real skill to make an app this unuseable and unreliable. Is it possible to give minus stars?
2619,This new app sucks. Bring back the old one which was much more intuitive to use.
2620,Not good as old one... new feature does not provide proper info
2621,The worst app I have ever seen. Have the Ux designer or any of the developers ever flown? This is enough for me to go back to WestJet.
2622,Air Canada has again made their app less functional with every update. Big fail
2623,Previous version had alot. This appears to be extremely downgrade
2624,Can't add my flights/ bookings. Awful awful experience...
2627,Completely useless for me...was never able to retrieve any of my reservation so I have usles icon in my phone.
2628,All the prices are fake. When you go to the airport all the prices are higher from those posted.
2629,useless app after update. kinda suits aircanda in general I guess. awful company/flight experience. shame there is no real competition for where I fly otherwise I would not use. Dont waste your time with this app
2630,Worst app ever. No where near being user friendly. Strongly prefer the older version.
2631,Useless!!!!! Can't even book oneway flight! App keeps stopping.
2632,So just downloaded the app for sole purpose of entertainment requirements and voila no rouge player capability. What the heck. Android device galaxy s8?
2634,Hate this app. Not nearly as easy and user friendly as the previous one.
2635,I cant find seats preview. I cant see upgrade option .
2637,Doesn't work well and crashes.
2638,At checkin they are not able to read the boarding pass barcode
2639,"Everytime I log in, it immediately logs me out."
2640,"I can not see my booking, just in website."
2641,A lot less informations than the old app. If this is all we will get with it then I will remove it as it is useless.
2642,Sorry something went wrong....great update no longer works
2644,My flight dissapeared from the app and I cant add it back in. Unreliable app
2645,Garbage. Lots of error messages
2646,no option to reserve seats. cannot find it anywhere in the new app
2648,Slow and stops working half way through a task
2649,Painful. I live in London and have tried to check-in and choose my food preferences. Instead of doing that I was taken on pointless journeys that didn't produce anything but dead ends that produce unhelpful list of pssible reasons why I can't do what I am trying to do. As such I expect a typically disappointing AC flight tomorrow.
2650,"Arrived in Frankfurt, Germany on AC flight from Toronto, connecting on to Lufstansa flight to Dehli (4 of us) when boarding, there were close to 30 other Passengers all whom scanned in throughbthe agents but Lufstansa said our 4 tickets were cancelled from Toronto and were not allowed to board. How did we even get onto the toronto-frankurt flight in the first place?!? No one from Air Canada is replying to this outrage, lufstansa blamed AC and AC agents were no where to be located in Frankfurt!"
2652,"Nothing worked, wouldn't even pull in my bookings."
2653,Needs work... Cannot add booking
2654,The old app was informative and useful. The new app is neither
2655,"Cannot figure out how to see my seat. Cannot find any info on eupgrade, etc. I could find that info in the old version."
2658,"Very good app ,very useful"
2659,After forced nov 2019 update app wont open. Too nad i have to give it a star at all.
2660,New update is awful. Keeps crashing
2662,Check-in page freezes regularly
2663,Could not find my digital personal Altitude card
2664,Removed most useful features. My least favourite app ever. Very awkward.
2665,There should be an option for zero stars. Since the update nothing in this app works.
2666,Honestly the worst app in the industry. Nothing works for months and the UI is a hipster joke. Any senior position working on this pile of trash should be fired.
2668,When I try to download this on my Fire tablet I can't enter anything. It is greyed out where you would enter your system?
2669,"The new version of the app is quite bad and not sure why it was necessary as the old one worked great, but it's gone downhill since the revamp. While it may be more pleasing to look at it has many flaws such as error messages and things most people need the most such as check in and boarding passes are not as easily found."
2670,"The worst app ever. Good intentions, bad product. Does not delivery on what was advertised."
2673,This app can't find flights booked by CWT.
2674,New app is horrible and awful.. Missing most of the basic features. Design and flows are brainless.. No option to use points to upgrade seats.. No easy way to manage check in.. No notification on your flight being ready for check-in. Getting boarding passes is pain in the butt... Hope they scrap this garbage app and give us back the old app..
2675,Liked the old app better...at least it worked! Loaded.d this on my galaxy tab 8 and it worked fine on my trip to florida but refused to work on the return trip to Toronto (the rouge portion). Said I needed a newer android version when I already am running android 9.0 on the tablet. Not impressed!!!!
2676,"This app is useless, none of the flight notifications are reliable. I would expect more from such a big company. Can no longer use e-upgrades online which caused me to lose 30 credits in the new year. Unbelievable."
2677,Tried to add a booking and it crashed ....
2678,Did not import ptevious oinfo and will nt accept current data such as aeroplan numbwr
2679,"Absolutely useless App. Doesn't do the basic task of loading a booked flight. Says there is an error they will work on it. Hasn't worked for 3 months or more, still won't load flight info. Should be an option of zero stars, 1 is too good for this app."
2680,"useless app, crashed on every logins"
2681,So much worse than previous app. Basically unusable
2682,Could not complete the check in
2686,Can't find my reservation when I input my last name and reference number
2687,Doesn't work won't accept my booking number
2688,Very frustrating. Old app worked great. Went to use it today and it said upgrade must be installed. Clicked on upgrade. Result? My device is not compatible with new version. Clicked on uninstal to go back. Result? No AC app anywhere on my phone. So I go to Playstore to download AC app. Result? No AC app listed. AC Cargo yes. Rouge yes. AC Trip Pass yes. Aeroplan yes. Westjet yes. Delta yes. United yes. But no AC app on list. This is my wife's old phone which is linked to her Google account that is set to to US address. This has been a problem before when apps such as Bell are not available from US Google store. But AC? Don't US residents need an AC app too? Typical upgrade frustrations. Did I mention I hate software upgrades?
2690,"Awful app. Unable to do anything on it, except load the app, no matter how many times i re-install. Could not retrieve confirmed flights or even search for upcoming flights to book. Truly disappointing and poor user experience."
2691,"The new app is bad and a leap backwards from the old version. There is no functionality at all. When you log in, it tells you that you've logged out. You can't check in - directed to web browser. Seat change options available on PREVIOUS flights. No link to Altitude...you are going to lose us. Call centre folks are helpful & taking wrath for bad decisions of app & reservation system. Yes...had to call...on a phone...like 1991. Bring back the old app...and give all the call centre folks a bonus."
2692,"This app is so bad. Not user friendly at all....r u guys even serious. Just copy your competitors, you obviously cant figure it out on ur own."
2693,In an airport in Puerto Vallarta trying to download app to watch movies (required to have) - ok - so given the location I figured I'waIt until we got back to our connection flight in Toronto Int'l. Same problem ... App would not / could not / did not connect after over an hour. Jeez ... What's the point AC??
2694,"Nothing works, my trips can't be found. Check in did not work and after check in on the web with the same account, boarding pass did not appear in the app. Has been in this state for weeks now."
2695,"Brutal, can't book flights on it!"
2696,"Last update after AC took over Aeroplan is pretty useless. Bare bones functionality that does not add any value. I cannot see my Aeroplan status, cannot request upgrades, boarding passes are separate from bookings, so on so forth. I see no reason to use this app. The only hope I have is that this release is a placeholder until AC completes consolidating Aeroplan fully. AC: please consult travellers on what functionality they use before pushing updates."
2697,ABSOLUTE TRASH. Kept on crashing after using it once so for my connecting flight I can't even get my boarding pass.
2698,Terrible app.. Doesn't even open.. what a waste of time...
2699,This app does not even work. Useless. Bring back the old one!
2700,Crashes every 3 seconds
2701,"I loved the old version, all my information was visible once I logged in, it gave me countdowns to my travel dates and the app was easy to maneuver. This new version is unremarkable, and the layout is horrible, I don't even know where to look to update my information. Very disappointed."
2702,"I downloaded to get access to inflight entertainment on a transatlantic flight. The process is NOT intuitive. One must use the app to get access to the wifi login page, then hunt around for the entertainment stream versus the pay wifi and then have to download the another .apk file to get the movie, but the download link was 404. Don't depend on Air Canada rouge for anything."
2703,"Not able to use it for check in (always an error at the end tried for 4 flights), boarding pass needs to be entered by booking number (why if I already have it on my phone from email), literally useless for anything that flight app should be fore. The makers of this app should study Lufthansa app which is an enormous help including automatic check in for domestic flights and has air miles programme included-all in one app."
2705,This app is terrible.the old AC app was far better. This one doesn't keep track of my trips without constantly putting in my booking number which sort of defeats the purpose of the app. Plus I shouldn't have to provide my aeroplan number over and over which again defeats the purpose of the apo! it sends me constant errors. GARBAGE!
2706,App constantly crashes.
2707,"Very poor interface. Much worse than the previous version. Less functionality and options. Doesn't seem to retain bookings. In this day and age, when I have signed in, I should not have to retain a paper copy so I can look up my booking reference."
2708,I hate it. I dont see my seat selection anymore. So Frustrating
2709,My flight is today and the update is not allowed for my account. It says that the app is not available for my account and now I have no access to my boarding pass. There was no warning yesterday when I checked into the flight. How can you lock users out when your new version clearly hasn't been tested AC?
2710,"Garbage, you've ruined the app!!! You had a great app before this version, all you've managed to do is ruin the user experience! Linking to external websites in an app doesn't make it better either, slower and less intuitive to use. Comes as no surprise from AC."
2711,"No longer able to use this app on Blackberry Priv Android OS. Used it in the past, and on trip last week, can no longer load ""incompatible with your device""."
2712,Upgraded app no longer compatible with my phone. I will need to replace my flagship android device just to use this AC app. I'd rather just switch carrier. United for all it's deficiencies at least has a decent app that will allow me to check-in and use an eBoarding pass.
2713,"App is extremely slow, sluggish and mostly opens a browser page, which sort of defeats the purpose of having a dedicated application.."
2714,"Horrible app...the old product was very good. I cannot make a booking or retrieve my old booking. Always getting messages - technical error- I was very happy with the previous version, not sure why they have change a good working platform to worse experience."
2716,Concise and informative
2717,Forced an update while in line at airport and lost by boarding passes. Then it won't let me re-enter my passport number because it says my phone number is invalid but it was successfully verified. This new version is useless. No QA has been done on this
2718,Can't add my reservation. Just installed and giving it 1 star in less than 5 minutes. Adding reservations is a basic function but got an error.
2719,"Don't bother downloading! I avoid this app as much as I can. I needed to download an old boarding pass for reimbursement, so I downloaded it again. Big mistake. It glitches and says my airplane mode is on when it isn't, then logs me out and says I need to reset my password to login again. This happened multiple times. Thirty minutes of this and I'm no closer to getting my boarding pass!"
2720,"I previously used the app for travel to scan boarding pass and it wasn't that bad. Sometimes it takes a long time to load when you have to get the boarding pass, so I had to load it and leave it up so when I get to the agent I just unlock my screen to scan. It works in that sense. however recently because of some breach of security, no fault of my own, air canada locked my account and REFUSES to unlock it. Now the entire App is USELESS to me, I tried creating a new account but my aeroplan card and points are linked to the old account. I am encountering an issue on my Air Canada Mobile App. I have been having this problem since December and was unable to use the app for my travel during that time which was a huge inconvenience and disappointment. The issue is that when I attempt login on the app, it tells me my account is locked due to too many failed login attempts (See attachment below). When I try to reset the password, I never receive the password reset email (I checked junk folders etc). I have attempted password reset via, the App and the Web. On Air Canada and on Aeroplan. Please unlock my account or delete it so I can create a new one. This is causing me a lot of stress!"
2721,"The new version doesn't work on my Samsung J7! I can't look for flights, can't add my trips...fix it please I need this app!"
2722,"Installed it on my Android before going onto my 11 hour flight to Japan, thinking I can stream movies on the entertainment page to keep me occupied for the long flight. The first 4 hours of the flight the entertainment page did not work at all, switching back and forth between the loading screen and the red ""entertainment system not available"" screen. During my fifth hour I was delighted to finally be able to connect, only to be disappointed again due to the movie stopping every 10 seconds to buffer (this is after a full three cycles of watching numerous ads). I overheard other passengers complaining about the app as well. It was not a full flight, so I don't think the volume of people trying to access it was the problem. The issues did not resolve even after turning my phone off and on again (the only advice the cabin attendant could give), so I gave up for the next couple hours. During the final hours of my flight, I thought maybe the streaming would be better than what I experienced before, but the entertainment page did not connect at all and went to a blank screen."
2726,Last update is a disaster. We leave for home in a few hours and can't check-in or load boarding passes. Error. Error. Error. Was great on way here with previous version. Too bad.
2727,I couldn't believe this was the same airline I use regularly. The app is hopeless for checking existing flights or for booking a new flight. So what is it supposed to be good for?
2728,"Failed at a critical function. Do not rely on this app to make your boarding passes available on your phone when you need them! I used it to check in for my two-leg flight the day before, and selected to send the boarding passes to the app. I checked and they were both there. They were still both there when I boarded the 1st flight. But then at my layover I had to go through Canadian Customs and when they asked for my next boarding pass it was gone!"
2729,"Confusing interface where the menus and back button change context in the middle of a process. Times out constantly while trying to check-in. When starting to check-in, you cannot do it from your saved bookings (have to retype booking reference number). Has never let me download a boarding pass to the phone, and I always need to go to the counter anyway."
2730,This is terribly hard to download on my laptop. Don't bother to download - it's a crappy app just like their seats on their Rouge planes. Air Canada should be ashamed at the their entry level 'expertise' with their amateurish IT dep't.! Too bad they're Canadian - gives us a bad name.
2731,"They don't tell you before you board that you have to download their app so you can access the onboarding wifi since there are no TV screens. So if you don't realize that until you're on the plane, then you're out of luck. Nothing for 6 hours. Lame."
2733,"I was trying to change the flight through application and it didn't work. I went through all the steps until final payment step, added my credit card and I was getting ""no fares found"" error message for any flight I was trying to change. and I still get this errors. So the price went up twice and now if I want to change I have to pay double price because of this error. Absolutely bad experience during Christmas. Called Air Canada and no help. They said price changed and nothing they can do."
2734,"Uninstalled, nothing works now. Simple."
2735,"I've booked ticket on air Canada via cleartrip but it's not showing in the mobile app, but it showing in web well. Why not app??"
2736,It's useless to download this app. it doesn't work. I have tried in more than 4 flights and we always get the same excuses 'the wi_fi is not working' 'we are sorry but there are more than 200 passengers trying to connect'... Air Canada Rouge is not ready to provide this service. last Saturday I got a card of discount for my next flight. if you insist the flight attendant will give you one of these excuse cards they keep in their pockets. stop misadvertising Air Canada Rouge!
2737,"App was constantly spinning its wheels, trying to refresh or login but always told me no network was available. The phone was connected to my home wifi and every other app could connect to the internet fine, just not this one. I played with permissions and tried on mobile data instead of wifi, but nothing worked. After 20 minutes of trying to get it to work I just deleted it, not worth the hassle."
2738,"Ever since they got hacked, the app has been horrible. Every time I open the app, it asks me to reset my password (which I have done numerous times). I cannot link my aeroplan, it just keeps asking for a password. They are also not using proper password fields anywhere in the app, this means that autocorrect memorizes your password making it easy for the app to get hacked again."
2739,"I'm US citizen flying YYZ to YVR with no Aeroplane account and no need to create an account. I just wanted the app to retrieve the digital version of my flight...unfortunately the only feature that I am requesting does not work! Very basic input---Booking Reference and last name.... ""Booking Reference not found. Please try again."" Seems like a pretty basic request that unfortunately cannot be honored :( I even liked to see if there was a US English version, but to no avail."
2740,"New app in place, and so far so good. Cautiously optimistic (added two stars to previous review)"
2742,Useless. It doesn't work. It breaks all the time.
2743,"I had the problem as most of the people here, password not working. It'll tell you that you forgot your password then you are trapped in reset password circles. No new passwords of your choosing will meet the criteria and there is no customer or technical support at all. I have never been able to log into my account though the app. But if you don't login or create an account you can just search with your booking number your aeroplan number and personal information are on display, no protection."
2744,"The airline itself is quite good but this app and system integration is poor. When you log in with your Aeroplan number it doesn't pull your flights automatically, need to add manually. It doesn't allow scanning documents, need to use their site. It doesn't remind to register on time - I got a push notification 50 min after the check-in started. After you check in online, need to do it again in the app if want to see boarding pass. Comparesd with Delta or JetBlue, this app is lacking."
2745,"They changed the login to use Aeroplan credentials but limit the password length to 10 characters. Guess what app business analysts, it's longer on Aeroplan site and on the Air Canada web site."
2746,Creating on launch while retrieving bookings
2747,"I keep getting prompted to reset my password every single freaking time. I've been through the reset process multiple times and it never works. This app has been broken since it got hacked, and the customer support is pretty horrendous - all the the emails, instructions and messaging I've seen make it pretty clear that Air Canada thinks the burden of responsibility for getting the app working again rests with the user. Typical."
2748,"I have a couple annoyances with this app: 1: Viewing the boarding passes is a hassle. You can only view your boarding pass for the current leg, not for the entire trip. It doesn't always register that you've arrived at your next airport, so it doesn't sequence to the next boarding pass. It would be nice to have access to all passes of a trip all the time. 2: When looking up the status on a flight, you need both the dep and dest airports. It would be nice if you only needed one or the other."
2749,"I have never written a positive review of this app, so why start now? I was just using it a few moments ago, trying to book a flight and was surprised at how easy it was! That surprise was short lived, however, as I was unable to actually purchase the flight. 3 times I tried. Each time, i would get a notification from AMEX that a charge had hit my card, however I received a technical error EVERY. TIME. On the app, the flight i wanted was $919. On the website, THE SAME FLIGHT WAS $1100 roughly. Great business you guys have. After the 3rd attempt to book the flight, I was forced to use the webpage. Of course, that worked and now I have to pay $200+ MORE. NOW I have to call AMEX and make sure Air Canada didn't charge me the additional 3 times."
2750,"First, you aren't told you need the app to watch Air Canada Rouge onboard movies until after you've boarded. On the way home, it took four phone reboots to make it work - marginally. Even then, the viewing experience is substandard - 3 minutes of viewing followed by 2 minutes of black screen as the next portion downloads. In the end, I just gave up and went back to my book."
2752,"This app is incredibly awkward to use. It doesn't automatically associate your booked flights. You have to add each and every flight, request to be notified, request that boarding passes be added and doesn't recognize when you've already checked into a flight. Pretty much all functionality is done by the user as they go through, nothing is automatically handled. It's incredibly frustrating in 2019 to need to use an app that is this outdated. And how do you access loyalty program information?"
2753,Been using it for years and it continues to be the most unreliable piece of software I use. I frequently cannot access my boarding pass when I actually need it. AC should be embarrassed by this though their website is not far behind. Unfortunate AC is the only sent airline with tied to the US from Canada.
2754,"Unfortunately this app is a very amateur piece of software with loose ends hanging all over the place. It is poorly designed, works badly or not all most of the time, hangs and crashes a lot and does not do very well what is should be doing. For entertainment it took me over 30 minutes to figure out what I needed to do (i.e. installing another untrusted app player) but I was finally able to listen to a movie. Lots of work before it becomes a useful and trustworthy app."
2756,"Mostly functional. Mostly. I get a never ending reminder that my Aeroplan credentials are invalid, despite having updated them several times. Occasionally I'll be unable to check in, met with a blank screen. I'm also not able to change my seat, but my friend with an iPhone can do so on theirs. It gets the job done most of the time but is far from slick."
2757,Checkin never works anymore.
2758,"This app crashed at the most critical time at the final security clearance at YVR. It would then not log me back in to retrieve the QR code boarding pass. They sent me back to the AC check in counter. My advice is to screenshot the boarding pass. I wrote to AC to inform them of the glitch but to this day not a reply from them. Seems like no one is held accountable (*hint* app developers, IT). The app has now been deleted."
2759,"The worst! I have to use this app to be able to watch movies and such on Air Canada Rouge flights but I don't trust the info on it, for example it says to pick up luggage at Vancouver at specific carousel but it also says I do not need to pick up luggage in Van, which one is it? I recommend not relying on it for receiving updates on your flights, use sms or email instead."
2760,The app is terrible. You can't check in. It keeps saying sorry and it will be look after. No response. Going to delete it and reinstall it and hope this helps.
2761,"The app crashes about once per hour. It has my flight info and works when I open it. But I get a notification about once an hour that it has crashed and to close it. So I close the app and clear all running apps and then it just keeps coming back, even though I'm not opening it or trying to access it or anything associated with it."
2762,"Horribly slow, very inconsistent and after the last update when I hit Continue when trying to check in with my booking reference or Aeroplan number nothing happens. AC ever hear of Single Sign In? I have to continue to login to all you websites separately. This app has a long way to go before it is anywhere near other airline apps."
2765,"Wasted hours, entirely unacceptable."
2766,"It will not allow you to link an Aeroplan Account, if the Aeroplan was already linked to a different email address. Lost access to an email account, so created a new AC Mobile+ account. But Aeroplan is already linked, so it's not able to link these anymore! Tried contacting support on several occasions and never got any response."
2767,App keeps saying my password is wrong but it is not. App says it can't find my flights because my phone is offline which is completely false I have wifi and lte. App would not give me my boarding pass I had to go to the air canada counter at Pearson in person to get it. App needs to install itself on external storage in android. I am very dissatisfied.
2768,"The latest app update of March 27 is still garbage. On my smartphone and my tablet, whenever I start the app I get the message ""unfortunately, Air Canada has stopped"" . Where is your quality control to check out the updates before released. This is totally unacceptable. I wonder if anyone ever checks these reviews! This happened back last fall and it took a couple of months to rectify!"
2769,Attempted to book a flight to Mexico City. *The app tells me there are no flights available for my dates whereas the website offers 8 options for the same dates. *App warns that prices will be displayed in US$ (WTH??) but elsewhere we are advised that bookings made through the app can only be paid in Canadian dollars. Perhaps this part of the app is not yet ready for prime time?
2770,"Air Canada mobile+ has been discontinued The Air Canada account is evolving in 2019, making way for a new and improved log-in experience. As part of this evolution, the Air Canada mobile+ service has been discontinued. With the exception of Air Canada mobile+ account features, all other functions of the Air Canada App and Flight Pass App will continue to be available, including booking, flight status, flight notifications, check-in and boarding pass. Therefore you can't log in."
2772,"Does not and will not remember AC Mobile+ password. No matter how many times it is entered, I keep getting the pop-up asking me for the Mobile+ password even after it's been reset several times. In addition, my 5 letter name gets chopped on all my AC tickets and boarding passes, even though it is spelled correctly and completely on the AC website and on my itineraries and receipts!"
2773,"cant show my boarding pass at the gate as the app is demanding a ""recommended update."" Can this app get any worse? Updated Sept/19 update: now it can't find my boarding pass even when i download it by sms. With the app installed i cant see e-boarding passes that Air Canada sends by sms: have to delete the app to be able to use by boarding pass, which is nuts."
2774,"Attempted to check in with the app ~4 hours prior to departure. Check-in may or may not have worked (still waiting; will check at the airport), the boarding passes it ""displayed"" were botched, and I couldn't access any other information about any flights or other bookings because the app failed to detect network connection even while I was connected to WiFi. Completely unusable."
2775,Wheres the -5*. Awful. Just Installed and spent an hour and a half trying to configure. Says my password too short. Too long. I logged out and tried to log back in. Fail. I have password keeper so i know it was right. Then it locked me out for 2 many failed attempts. Finally got back in and all my set up was gone. No name. No phone. No bookings. This is going in the trash. I have Delta app and took me less than 5 minutes to set it up.
2776,"Awful. Recieved email to link my aeroplan to the app, which i did years ago but somehow or other i have to do it again. Rejected my password even though it is valid, reset my password, which was rejected as it was the same as my old (supposedly incorrect) password, then it wants to reconcile the 2 accounts but claims i'm not online, even though i clearly was. Will delete the app. Another reason to simply not do business with Air Canada or Aeroplan."
2777,Air Canada provides the worst online/app experience . Can't check in through the app. Can't log in or link to app online. American Airlines and Westjet (that only provides non-stop service to my city seasonally) have online services that work seamlessly. There are little things that reflect poorly on Air Canada. For example not putting a space between my name and first initial. It's so unprofessional. I am an application developer and I would be embarrassed to release this product.
2778,"I recently read the many negative reviews for this App, and when my experience was even worse I wrote a scathing review. They say that time heals all. So now I can say that everything is changed. I again flew AC, and this time the App worked very well, exactly as it should. So I hope anyone who read my earlier review now reads this one. And I do congratulate Air Canada for finally getting it right."
2779,Terrible update. Poor UI/UX. Important information hidden under More tab like Check-in or Boarding passes. Usually an update improve the application. I miss the old one.
2780,"The entertainment section of this app deserves a 0 star rating. You can't fast forward, rewind or pause the movie. So if you have to go to the bathroom you have to leave the movie running and just miss that part. Also if you accidentally hit your home button the play stops and won't resume so you have to start back at the beginning and once again no fast forward. At this point I just gave up and read my book. What a piece of junk."
2781,this app worked okay on my first leg of my trip. I had checked in on my laptop. For my return flight I only had my new Samsung Galaxy tablet to check in. At the end of entering my information it indicated an error. I went back to start and it indicated I was checked in and downloaded my boarding pass. I checked how to access it successfully. The next day when I arrived at the airport I just got a message that the app was not available and a message it was slowing down my tablet!
2782,"Horrendously dumb ap. Even once you've created an account and signed in, added your flights, and added your passport details, you still need to re-enter your booking number and passport number to actually check in. At which point, why not just use the normal web page?! This app is a complete piece of garbage whose it purpose appears to be to sell you upgrades. Do NOT install."
2783,"I have an Andriod phone. My wife has an Apple phone. We have both tried to download this app on the flight so we can watch a movie or tv on our 10 hour flight as advertised by Air Canada. I even bought their high speed internet to download the app. That also did not work. Furthermore, we have had our light on for 3 hours on an international flight and no one has answered. Bad app. Bad airline. Bad experience."
2784,"Disaster. Was good app, unuseable now. Can't get into home screen. Have uninstalled and reloaded a few times. Same result. Air Canada, shame on you."
2785,App. fails upon phone startup so hopefully is being worked on. We traveled on a Rouge flight that counts on this app for entertainment in November when it wasn't crashing. Movies would crash out after showing you commercials. We gave up on it after a few tries. It's a disservice to the airline to have such an unstable entertainment system.
2786,Do not book flights on this app. It still has so many bugs in it. Still trying to deal with a charge on CC for a flight that doesn't seem to exist on Air Canada's end. I recommend downloading your movies and shows onto your device over downloading this app for entertainment.
2787,"I've given it 1 star because I can at least get my booking as a ""guest"" BUT its utter rubbish! I've tried several times to login to Mobile+ but it keeps coming back with ""connection failed"" despite the fact that all other apps are working fine. I've reset the password, restarted my phone and deleted and reloaded the app. Utter rubbish!"
2788,"Just received notification that this app was going to be replaced with a new app and that I will have to link my Aeroplan number to the app or information won't be migrated over. I clicked on ""link your Aeroplan number"" and was told that since my middle name was not on my Aeroplan account it did not match my AC account name. I stopped, logged into my Aeroplan account on a computer and added my middle name. However, I can no longer link my number (""wrong # or password""). Frustrating!"
2789,"Pretty crappy app. It loads slow and keeps quasi-crashing while I search up flight info, requiring me to return back to home and start again. Almost easier to wait in line at the customer service desk. The epitome of 1 step forward, 3 steps back. Check-in is marginally smoother, 1 step forward, 2 steps back."
2790,"The media player is a different app that you need this app to download, and can be only downloaded on air Canada Rouge's slow wifi network. Its about 45 minutes to download, and you will inevitably have to start over again multiple times due to their poor network quality, but they will offer tablets with the media player pre-installed to a select few people... for a fee."
2791,"This app is marginal at best. There are some decent features but services that you really need when, for example, you want to book a flight after the current flight that you're on experiences maintenance problems - a regular occurence it seems on Air Canada - do not work and yield meaningless error messages, such as ""technical problem""."
2792,The app doesn't show all the flights and even says that there is no flights available while when checking from a computer flights are available. The app shows that I can bid for an upgrade for my next flight in the home screen and when I click it tells me doesn't qualify. I kept getting the alert to change my password long after I had change it.
2794,"It only works about 1/4 of the time. Randomly says ""not available"" more often than not. It's actually comical how bad this app is. I frequently find myself shaking my head and laughing at it's inadequacy. Humour is the only way to stop yourself from throwing your phone at the wall while using this app."
2795,"I am raising my stars from 1 to 2 only because I found the cause of the crashes. If the app is started in Portrait mode it will start up but like many, I use my tablet in Landscape mode which is for the Rouge Player. In Landscape mode it crashes. Please fix this nasty bug and I will increase my rating."
2796,"Cannot log in since end of August. Air Canada web site works fine but any attempt to sign in fails in this app. Called Air Canada and was told that this app is ""maintained by Aeroplan"" and that ""Air Canada doesn't have anything to do with it"". Dead end. Utterly useless."
2797,Hate the new app. Less information available in a less accessible form. Everything I liked about the old app is gone. WTG Air Canada - will be deleting.
2798,"Too many bugs with the app. I use it frequently and it always forgets my aeroplan password. I have had to reset it because the app says its wrong even though it isn't. I have had a lot of issues checking in, system glitches etc. I like air canada but there are a lot of issues with this app."
2799,"Let me down at the worst time. I had pre-loaded my boarding pass in the app no problem before arriving at the airport. As I approached security, the app randomly decided that it wanted to apply an update and gave me only one choice - Update now. Needless to say, i was forced to stand outside security while my phone fought through airport wifi to download the update, then install it, before I could finally get back to the simple boarding pass. This is a poorly designed feature!"
2800,I had my bookings on my Samsung tablet and now they are gone and when I update is says it is not a compatible device. Why is it not compatible when it was before?
2802,"It has worked well for me when retrieving boarding passes amd receiving notifications to flight status, but on-flight entertainment was a huge pain. Not a good system implemented with their app whatsoever. Could not get their entertainment app installed on the phone because of errors or redirects and instructions were vague. Unable to book multi-city flights. Had to end up using their website."
2803,"When Air Canada made a delay update for boarding and take off, the previous electronic boarding pass disappeared, and the new one would not appear. This caused me the inconvenience of standing in line and asking Air Canada personal to print mea boarding pass. This happened twice. Baltimore to Toronto and the return trip from Toronto to Baltimore. Delay updates by the Airline removes your electronic boarding pass, SO PRINT A BOARDING PASS in addition just incase. I deleted the APP."
2804,"Cannot login to the app. I have reset my password successfully as per instructions and the request sent from the app. I can login to the Mobile + website (the mobile + services website, not Aeroplan, not AirCanada) just fine. Tried in the app multiple times and still tells me that i have the wrong password or may not have an account. The app does not provide any support links or info to resolve this issue. The website mobile+ version that i can login to is also useless at providing help."
2805,"Dreadful. Downloaded the Air Canada app onto my Android phone before take off, then had to download another app called Air Canada Rouge whilst in the Air to watch the in-flight entertainment. This took nearly an hour and kept pausing unaccountedly. When it did eventually install, every time I launched it, it just went to a blank white screen so no entertainment for 3.5 hours. Westjet's app is infinitely better."
2806,"Unable to display Prestige Status. The app has changed a bit recently. Used to be able to go to setting and view your Altitude status card, e.g. 25K, 35K, 50K, 100K, etc. The same option simply disappeared. Now that you don't mail us the status card anymore and ask the member to use the app to show the status but it is broken."
2807,"App incorrectly lists TPE (Taipei) as being in China, which it is not"
2808,"I flew to Montreal and on the flight there I was notified of a Gate change and given an amended boarding pass for both my flights. On my flights back, both my flights had changed gate and not once was I notified by this app that my Gate had changed. Isn't the point of the app to make your life easier so you don't have to look at Airport screen in regards to flight information and gate departures? I'll stick to the Westjet app and Westjet as the Westjet app actually works properly all the time!"
2809,"Air canada needs to hire a UX designer to work on the onboarding process. Having to sign up for a completely separate account from your existing Air Canada account, then having to manually enter your own flights makes the process of using this app slow and clunky. Also, it breaks halfway through check-in. Continue, back and quit buttons all do nothing. Seems like an app designed by developers with no concept of using the product."
2810,"Please bring back ""standby and upgrade list"". Plsssssss"
2811,"worst app ever!!! Downloaded it but sadly never got to use it on the flight! Just kept asking me to download some apk on my Android device! absolutely ridiculous! Air Canada is my last resort anyway! I couldn't do better! Take a flight on WestJet and experience an airline that supercedes expectations! From the friendliness of the flight attendants and crew, to the service, AC just doesn't cut it for me! sheesh!"
2813,"Useless, big fail. Installed the app so I could watch movies on the next Rouge flight. Tried launching the viewer (ahead of the flight) to make sure it works but it failed with message that I must be connected to a Rouge wifi first). Once on the flight, I connected to the wifi and tried again. Told to install the Rouge player (then what is this app for???) Very slow download that kept failing part way through. Eventually I gave up trying. Also could not create an account. Yep, useless."
2814,"Do not trust the app, particularly to buy Maple Leaf lounge access using app - ongoing technical issues that have been reported by me alone 3 times in the past year - when you have 2 or more layovers, the app randomly assigns access to ONE lounge but the app confirms a visit to all of them. When you check in at the lounge and ask for clarification, they tell you ""sorry - it won't be a problem"" but then you get stonewalled when you show up at the lounge (the only one you were intent on using)."
2815,Half the app works. But on rouge flight it serves as the player for in flight entertainment. 8h flights and it hasn't worked once. Second 8h hours flight it crashes everytime after the 5 min publicity. Everytime. I managed to listen to a kid movie because they don't have publicity in them. This app is terrible.
2816,"Total garbage. Just had a 9 hour flight with no in flight entertainment because the new ""Air Canada Rouge"" entertainment app would not proceed past a blank white screen on any of the 3 devices we tried, that is after the nearly 2 hours spent trying to install it in the first place. Not looking forward to the next 5 hour leg... Frequently crashes during check in process and does not update flight information efficiently"
2817,Literally Garbage. The app opens a web page which opens the app which plays 1s of inflight entertainment and then closes back to the app to repeat the cycle. Who comes up with this?
2818,What a useless app. Asks me to add same info at every step. Unable to retrieve my boarding pass. Almost no functionality. Whoever developed this should be fired.
2819,Didn't work for in-flight entertainment for anybody within my line of sight. The lady across the aisle said it has never worked for her. The flight attendant said the system said 150 people were connected even though I didn't see anyone who was. Be prepared and bring a book or download Netflix instead.
2820,Horrible App - Come On Air Canada!! Unfortunately my company forces me to fly Air Canada even though West Jet is better. Every single time I open this app it takes at least a minute to open and then all my info isn't there - every single time. Which is a huge pain when just trying to open your boarding pass quickly - there is no quickly with this app. I've just given up using the app and now just email my boarding pass instead of using this sh1tty app!!
2821,"this app is ridiculous at best... the biggwst issue i have is that the check-in feature; some may argue one of the most important features, does not funtion at all. it loads as a blank oage and will eventually default to the ""timed out"" page.... i honestly do not enjoy air Canada, and this is just another reason why."
2822,"can't do anything cause it says ""network not available"", but I'm connected to both wifi and mobile and have internet access. checked the apps data usage and it's used 10kB of mobile data a few minutes after installing ....??? also the review average might be a little skewed with a top review saying ""pleasant staff"" lol"
2823,They broke it by updating. It's not supposed to work that way guys.
2824,The most painful app I've ever used in my life!!!
2825,This is one of the buggiest apps i have ever used. It is almost impossible to make your way through online check in in one try without it crashing baddly and refusing to let you progress. It's what you would expect from Air Canada
2826,"Check-in is error-prone, it regularly takes me multiple attempts to successfully complete a check-in. And stop making me log in to Air Canada mobile+ every single time. I use a password manager, don't make me have to open it up each time I want to pay for a checked bag. Step it up you guys."
2827,"Doesn't actually work. I can login via browser on windows laptop, after resetting password - I can see my account setting - so I have an account - but when I use the same id/pwd combo in my phone - it seems to think my account doesn't exist? I'm not really sure - definitely whatever msg Air Canada is trying to communicate is clear as mud. Would be nice if they can fix it so I can see if the app is actually useful?"
2828,"update takes 5 hours because there is A time limit if yoy missed 17 Nov? The other absurd thing is, old data NOT transfer ? Your app could win the worse app of the century !Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¡"
2829,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced, I purchased a flight using my debit card, I upgraded to business class using the machine when it offered to upgrade me for a fee, once I boarded the plane someone else was in my seat with the exact same ticket number, I was told to leave the plane. Instead I flew with WestJet that were absolutely wonderful and helped me with the bad mood after I had been embarrassed by AirCanada. 4 weeks later I am still trying to get the refund for the upgrade"
2830,"the layout of the app seems nice but it's consistently glitchy e.g. it never lets me check in, when i put my info in and click continue nothing ever happens. That has happened with other functionality as well. Fix these issues and it'll be a great app. I have a samsung S7 edge so it's a common device."
2832,This app is terrible. Especially since they changed it. Buying a ticket through the app doesn't link to my aeroplan number even though it's set in the profile. There is no sign in or out so there is no linked profiles. It crashes and is insanely slow. It's almost worse than having no app
2833,"App immediately asked for my location which I don't need to give because I'm just managing a booking. After that, it denied that i had internet access despite me having Wi-Fi and data since I'm at my own house. And I've used the same connection to download and now review the app."
2834,"Half of the main screen of the app is just a picture, why wouldn't you use limited screen space for info I would find helpful? Can't sign in using my Aeroplan account. My account info is correct, it just keeps pushing me back to the main screen when I enter my password. Bad. So bad..."
2835,"The Aeroplan/Altitude sign in experience is gloriously broken, ALL THE TIME. The face that Aeroplan is separate but intertwined with Altitude is cumbersome and not the smartest design by any stretch. I'll still use it, but I definitely don't like the app experience at all."
2836,"Website, not the app, will not let me search for a multi city trip with origin and final destination in the US. The middle cities are in Canada. Will stick with a US airline"
2837,"Possibly the worst app I've ever used, why bother investing so much money building a complicated entertainment feature to replace super cheap monitors if it doesn't work whatsoever? Makes me consider never flying Air Canada again. Friendly tip download lots of Netflix content before flying."
2838,extremely poor service. lots of bugs. i had trouble checking in online and the customer service was of no help at all. the website was super old and not at all readable. I ended up missing my flight because of the bad info i was fed from customer service. I am never taking air canada again.
2839,Totally useless app. I tried to create a profile and even though it says that supplying your Aeroplan number is optional it insisted I supply one and would not let me proceed until I corrected the missing information. I don't have an Aeroplan number.
2840,It's been recently found to record your screen and send screenshots back to the home server by using Glassbox for session replay. Credit card info isn't obfuscated. Too much of a security risk. Look up the article on TechCrunch on this.
2841,"It's great that I can have my boarding passes, but its horrible that the app doesn't update any changes to your booking, such as flight delays, gate changes, and seat changes. All of which are already updated on google."
2842,"Keep saying ""Network not available - turn off airplane mode or use Wi-Fi"" when all other applications are working fine except Air Canada! Cannot even sign in at all using my new Samsung A9 (2018). It was working on my old Samsung previously. Now useless!"
2843,"Pretty bad. The app seems to be more geared to trying to sell you stuff than dealing with your flights. Takes forever to load flight info. When you check in it always tells you at the end that checkin failed even though it worked. Cmon AC, you can do better!"
2844,To use the Air Canada Rouge player to watch in-flight movies you needed to be connected to the plane's wifi. I was connected but couldn't get the player to run. The content of what is available is a lot smaller than Air Transat's.
2845,"Always freezes when I try to enter my Aeroplan number so I have to check-in without it. Doesn't sync between phone and iPad. If I check-in on the app on my iPad, it doesn't show up in the app on my Google Pixel phone."
2847,Very weird layout in which it is pretty hard to find what really matters. Have had many bad experiences with Air Canada in the past as their customer service is slow and sluggish and their service agents have some of the worst attitudes. Will never book with Air Canada unless absolutely necessary.
2848,"Even though I had checked in online, the app kept indicating that I should check in. Horrible synchronization feature."
2849,"it simply won't load. the Rouge app was a farce. the Air Canada apps are essentially iOS only. if you use Android, don't bother, save yourself the frustration and print what you need ahead of time, download something to watch ahead of time."
2850,"Was much better b4. Can't login into the app, but no issues with the website login. APP login is email, while website is the AEROPLAN? Very confusing. I checked in via the website and somehow the boarding pass show up on the app (even though I am unable to login the app) Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¨Ã°ÂÂÂ²"
2851,"Infotainment for Rouge - Terrible. Would not keep a connection and crashes on my Android every time I try to play a TV show or movie. The previews and commercials, no problem, main feature, a no go. Come on Air Canada. Geeze."
2852,"Worst in flight entertainment experience ever. Out of 3 devices, none would load. Managed to get the iphone working after 1 hour of flight, only to have the movie freeze every 15 minutes. I don't know who thought of this app, but it's complete junk for rouge."
2853,Stopped working after update
2854,"What happened? App does not work anymore. Its terrible. Unable to Log In, Check In and screen often freezes when attempting to complete a task. This needs to get fixed."
2855,"Installed on phone and tablet, and on the phone it refuses to acknowledge it is online (keeps saying ""turn off airplane mode"" while not in airplane mode and connected to wifi). On a tablet connected to the same wifi it works fine .... so it's not the wifi, it's the app that sucks."
2856,"very bad app, nothing worked on the 10 hour flight. air canada rouge player took hours to download from planes network and when it finally did it would not connect to the plane entertainment network. don't bother to use it just preload your own media to use on the flight."
2857,"The app is slow to load, slow to load info, and doesnt connect to my flights automatically like the United app. It is also sending data daily, despite me flying air canada once every 6mo or so. What data are they harvesting from my phone? Would not recommend."
2858,Not bad overall. I had an issue using this at the gate when boarding because I update my seat preference at check-in booth (onsite) and the app never updated properly. So I got stopped at the gate and had to dig out my paper pass
2859,"Had downloaded app months ago, updated today and kept getting crash errors despite the fact I had never started the app. No reason for it to passively be running in a background and especially so when it constantly crashes."
2861,"I have made 7 roundtrip bookings in economy premium seats by this App. unfortunately, we all have given economy Basic seats for our return flight . I have made many attempts to communicate with the Air Canada regarding this problem. So far, no response. What a shame!Ã¢ÂÂ¹Ã°ÂÂÂ "
2862,"Problematic. Sometimes very slow, sometimes won't retrieve data at all. Won't switch to data when wifi unavailable. Many error messages. Newspaper reports of misuse of personal data."
2863,"I can't download, It downloaded halfway then stopped and disappeared, I can't check-in online from my computer or my phone, I can't do anything. The Air Canada website also will not let me check-in, will not tell me what the problem is. Not thrilled."
2864,"Can't sign in, can't create account, essentially cant do anything. I fly with AC at one return a week at least and I can't even use the app for notification or boarding passes or retrieving my bookings. How is it this hard to get an app to work..."
2865,This wasn't a very good app. Then you removed login and made it even worse! At least I used to get my bookings added automatically. Now I have to type them in. And your Flight Pass app doesn't even let me select the confirmation number!
2866,I literally depend on this app for my air travel needs. The app is too slow and needs lots of improvements. AC have a look a United app for inspiration. if possible atleast make the experience smooth.
2867,Works great if all you want to do is scan your boarding pass. Have had two flights in four days with gate changes that are not reflected in app. Needs updating.
2868,"your app is terrible, it has been downloading for 20 minutes and still no luck, the app sucks, so does your aircrafts. On a 10 hour international flight didn't have any entertainment, none of the cabin lights were working. Really??"
2869,"Terrible. compared to its competitors apps this app is stone age and largely useless. flight information i was tracking for my 11 hour delayed flight was updating hours after the delay, cant seem to online check in with any measure of confidence, etc"
2870,"Sucks! Over an hour to link and still not linked. Password issues, even though I know it's right. Says turn off flight mode and use wifi, DUH! I haven't been in flight mode for 3 months and I'm at home on my wifi. I give up. YOU SUCK!"
2871,"I sure hope they fix all the issues with logging in. Drives me crazy to try and access the altitude dashboard, app and aero plan sites. Other than that it would be nice if the Air Canada app linked you directly to the Altitude dashboard."
2872,"Garbage app. Android 9 on Pixel 3 xl. Rouge in-flight entertainment player does not work. 11 hours return trip unable to watch anything. It will play ads no problem though, then kick you back out to home page."
2873,"Terrible app cant even create a working account. Downloaded app, create a new account, enter password and account name. Try to login, password incorrect, reset password still incorrect. reset again still incorrect. Not to sure how to use the app considering you cant login."
2874,"Terrible. Cannot link my AeroPlan, cannot login or even create an account without the app failing and having connection issues. Absolutely rubbish. Emirates Airlines has a much better app and I never had any issues with it."
2875,"Terrible redesign of the app, keeps old boarding passes on my dashboard and encounters errors whenever I try to check-in"
2876,"This App is terrible. Always asking to reset my password when in fact, i did. It's super slow, wheel always spinning. Air Canada, do you not read these reviews??? Maybe make your app better than your customer service!!!"
2877,Absalutely horrible. 3 people in my group and not 1 of us could get this app working while in flight ( ac1810 ) on Dec.2 /18 . Two of us rented tablets for $10 after 90 mins of errors and failed attempts- the Air Canada tablets worked perfectly.
2878,"After the news today uninstalling. Did they really just say none of the data outside of fhe app is available for them to see. Thats not the point.... I'm not overly concerned about my privacy, but comments like that are clear privacy isnt even on the list...."
2879,"Installed before getting on a plane, then was notified by the app I needed to side load a new version of the Rouge app. Disappointing, like Air Canada. At least they are consistent."
2880,"App can't remember a booking number. Asks for Aeroplan info everytime its opened, annoying little things . Not a smooth app. Westjet app far better. By now AC should have enough tax payers dollars to pay a developer to make a better app."
2881,Never imports my flights automatically. Half the time it can't find already booked flights. Pretty useless if it can't even retrieve a booking properly. Other airline apps are much less of a hassle.
2882,"Confused and can't login. I've received multiple warnings that the old app won't work, use the new app - but I can't log in to this app I already had installed. What is going on Air Canada???"
2883,Old app was much better overall and had significantly better functionality that I used daily as a frequent traveler.
2884,Not even able to check for flights. It always give me an error message..... pathetic....
2885,"Unfortunately, I must say that this is an awful app. It kept crashing and simply did not work efficiently. Sad to say, it is equally as horrible as the service on its name sake airline, Air Canada."
2886,The application is a little slow but it works. I would give it 3 or 4 stars but for some reason it insists on charging me in USD when I book through the application.
2887,"Air Canada app still wont open. It's been roughly 1 month of being force closed when I try to open it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone, and force closed the app myself with no luck. I have a galaxy s6"
2888,"The app kept crashing, so I deleted it and reinstalled it. Now, it can't link my Aeroplan number to the app. It will ask for the Aeroplan password, then it tells me that the password isn't good."
2889,Crashes continually even when not running the app. A pop-up shows up every 5 minutes. I'm unsure how this got past internal testing. Unacceptable.
2890,Why do you need a separate account for this app? Why do I need two Air Canada accounts (3 if you count Aeroplan)? Why can't it pull my flight details from my linked Aeroplan account? Get it together!
2891,""" Fee Collection Incomplete It was not possible to complete this transaction. Please see an agent at Check-in Assistance to pay baggage fees and complete your check-in. "" Doesn't work."
2892,"Rarely works in the rouge entertainment system nowadays, this app directs me to download itself??? it is already installed and running! It used to work, I hope it's fixed soon."
2893,"App is unusable. I'm getting the same "" Network not available. Turn off Airplane mode or use Wi-Fi"" message others have reported. Same message whether I am on Wi-Fi or Mobile data. Reinstalled twice, no change. I'm using a Samsung S8+."
2894,"I had to update just before take off.. so it didnt work during my flight. At least let me run the app if I cannot update. It wouldnt open until I did, which meant no video service during flight since i could update."
2895,"A step backward. This app replaced a perfectly functional app. Long delay loading, screen stutters when scrolling. Some functions such as check in wil stop all together. Using web over app now. too painful"
2896,Doesn't always work. sometimes the check in page doesn't load or you cannot view your boarding pass. Very inconvenient.
2897,"This app is horrific. it took me over 20 min to log in because of how long it takes to contact servers, if it even makes it there. i have never been more frustrated using an app"
2898,"Downloaded and doesn't work. Keeps saying no network! And turn off airplane mode! I'm on WiFi. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice, but still doesn't work. Can hardly wait to fly with NO entertainment!"
2899,Glitchy. I am logged in to MY Air Canada account. I have one reservation for my family of 4. The only boarding pass in MY app is my WIFE'S. Luckily everyone else has all 4 boarding passes in their apps.
2901,"To launch the Rouge inflight entertainment it needs to download another app, and it won't let you do it off the plane, and on the plane it never fully completed the download (my flight was 4 1/2 hours)"
2902,Inflight entertainment barely functional. Low quality video and pause / seek functions don't work. Hope it doesn't drop your connection or you are starting over.
2903,"The App was working just fine but since the most recent update, it has been running in the background and crashes frequently."
2904,Does not work on my mini iPad pro 2019 version. I'm connected to the rouge wifi but the player from the app does not start. I've tried several times on several planes. It works well on Android though.
2905,Totally useless. I tried twice to create a profile - told not able to update and try again - same problem - didn't work again. As it happened I had downloaded the Air Transat app - no problems.
2906,"This would be a great app if it not for the persistent problems with attempting to sign in for altitude status. Each attempt results in ""system issue... please try again"""
2907,"App is not completely reliable, and sometimes isn't updated fully (i.e. baggage claim info, tracking is difficult, etc.) The app requires wifi to do anything, including just checking your boarding time"
2908,"Rediculous. I already have an Air Canada account and an Aeroplan account. I had to create yet another account for this app, and then it wanted me to create yet another account to merge my Aeroplan account. Get you $h!t together Air Canada"
2909,"Unusable. Just keeps saying ""Network Not Available"" I checked it has permissions to access both mobile data and wifi in case it was a subtle permissions issue but that's not the case..."
2910,"App is ok but not always consistent. Sometimes either missing info, or not updating changes in flight info, but overall ok. Make sure to also have backup paper copies of boarding passes and other documents."
2911,I hope the developer was fired on the spot unpon release of this terribly counterintuitive app
2912,TRAPPED IN LOOP of resetting password and won't log in! It used to be a great app but they have not fixed for a really long time.
2913,"default settings are set to scam. had an update and even though i chose Canada English, it defaulted to USD. It is not transparent or obvious at all that it is USD unless you scrutinize the fine print. caught it too late and no they won't make it right."
2915,Not great still not integrated with the website. Should be seamless. If you book on the phone it is not automatically in your online bookings.
2916,It doesn't connect to the database. Gives error. Totally useless.
2917,"If I need to download each airline app just for mobile check-in (since there is not the possiblity to use a single app for all the airlines), it is straightforward that each app can't be voted more than 1"
2918,The app keeps on crashing when you try to retrieve the boarding pass. Hopefully it's fixed before my flight tomorrow.
2919,"i don't normally leave feed back but this app has defeated me. it will not allow me to login, have set and reset the password 5 or more times, complete waste of time. Sort the issues out please."
2920,I didn't install this app. It asks for too many permissions. Why do you need access to my contacts? And to the camera? The last 13 reviews are all one star. Doesn't seem like Air Canada cares very much about their app.
2921,"Can't recognize my login credentials after several retries I am connected via Wi-Fi but states that I am in Airplane mode, too bad I can't post the screen shot of that Just finished uninstalling it and issues went away!"
2922,Absolute trash. Can't log in. Tells me to turn off vpn. I don't have a vpn. Check in notifications don't work until I open the app. Also no longer links to aeroplan so my points arent accumulated and won't put me in zone 2.
2923,Update will not load and blocks me from checking in. Very frustrating.
2924,"App itself is not bad, but Air Canada is the worst."
2925,Thought it was pretty good until the CBC report about Air Canada recording all app activity without actually telling users this was happening. This app is a virus.
2926,"terrible, terrible, terrible. You'd think you would be able to buy plane tickets on this app but it was never works. Always a technical error."
2927,The Rouge Player for entertainment never worked for anyone on our flight. It crashed as soon as the ads finished. Everytime. For 4 hrs.
2928,Its nice for electronic boarding pass but doesn't always work and is extremely slow when it does.. They've got miles of improvements before this could replace most free add-ridden flight trackers
2929,"Terrible app. Freezes my account any time I try to log in, and crashes when I try to check in for a flight."
2930,"waste of time.Awful ,awful,as cheap as Air Canada can be.You cannot check multiple cities, you cannot check in multiple pax,you cannot pay for extra baggage because of system errors.What a pathetic cheap ap. Can you see how United has done it? what a shame for air Canada-your greed will kill you some day."
2931,"By far, the worst app in my quiver. Constantly synching, which impedes the functionality of my device, and crashes repeatedly during use. I've uninstalled on account of these issues."
2932,"Worst app ever. Slow, freezes all the time. Take forever to load your boarding pass and checking-in. When sending boarding pass fellow travelers, they can't load it on their app!! Truly sucks!"
2933,"Is this the app of a world-class airline? No way to sign in, cites an invalid password / email combo even though they work well on the website. App used to work before it was replaced by this ""improvement""."
2934,"app is terrible, glitches out a million times during checkin, makes you redo everything. i was unable to check in at all due to errors."
2935,"Mediocre, buggy, inconsistent. Only use for a boarding pass really as i dont find it reliable in various aspects. I'm a former frequent flier and loyal to Air Canada / Star Alliance but...nope."
2936,Frequent notifications that the app is syncing even though I have syncing turned off. Also have to continually reset my password which is ridiculous. Makes the app frustrating to use.
2937,Just another data grab that steals your personal information and records your screen. This app is not even very effective at helping to check in and track your flights.
2938,"Useless. Cant make an account. Cant find flights. Cant log in. Cant find any details. Simply doesnt work, despite internet connectivity and different OS attempts."
2939,Does not have back key to make corrections on previous screens. Does not have a quick way to display boarding pass once the app is closed and you restart it.
2940,"always losing sync with Aeroplan, reports incorrect Aeroplan AQM miles for some flights, reports incorrect lounge access. Hard to maintain multiple passengers on one or more tickets."
2941,"Spent 20 mins in check in because flight didn't allow a single checked in baggage. After i made the payment, the app said my session expired wnd logged me out. Going to be a fun trip."
2942,"can not use says no internet connection, turn off airplane mode when it is not on, use wifi. I uninstalled two minutes after installing. garbage. fix this so it is usable"
2943,"Lots of bugs. App is free BUT it charges for movies! It's only a few bucks but still, I didnt realize until i saw the charge on my credit card bill later."
2944,"App doesnt work. Won't connect aeroplan number, made me pay for seat selection when it should not have, doesn't have any of my payment options on record. Usless"
2945,"bad. long waits to update info. Air Canada does not communicate well with their vacation department. this app is evidence of their miscommunications. upgrades and compensations are not displayed or honoured. bad app, bad service, bad company."
2946,"Recently when trying to book, i get a technical issue when it's trying to search about 75% of the time. It's very frustrating, time to book with Westjet again"
2947,"Way to complicated to book flights. Too co fusing. I had better luck with Westjet, Delta and American Airlines. Very, very sad for a Canadian company to be this disorganized."
2948,Horrible app. Keeps saying I am not connected to the internet when I clearly am. I hope their flights aren't as bad as this app.
2949,It doesn't work. Unable to retrieve booked flights blaming the network connection which works fine.
2950,"Unable to login. Keeps telling me to try later. AC website accepts my login and password, but not the app. Terrible."
2951,"I don't understand how a quality organization like air Canada releases such a poor quality app, and does nothing to fix it. Web check-in fails 80% of the time for me"
2952,Routinely fails in myriad ways. Have wearied of sending bug reports to AC. An unreliable app for a major airline.
2953,"Severely Limited Functionality on ASUS ZenFone 3. Rouge Player plays movies, but no button work on bottom of screen (play/pause/fast forward/rewind/settings buttons)."
2954,"Since Nov 30, the app crashes...this release I tonight will fix it, but it crashes right after opening...HTC m7, Android 5. Please test and fix."
2955,"Rouge Player a disaster. Only available on plane and took an hour to download and install. When run, just get white screen."
2956,"Rubbish. Can't even create a profile. Says ""turn off airplane mode"" when it's not in Airplane mode. Garbage app."
2957,"like others csn login or create a profile. Gives a please turn off airplane mode or check network"". My network is fine. this app is what is busted."
2958,Poorly implemented app that is unable to track whether or not you're checked in and retrieve your boarding pass. Do not depend on this app
2959,Can retrieve my damn booking! App doesn't work since the update.
2960,Can't even press the continue button half the time. It's Air Canada. I should have expected this.
2961,Doesn't work. Unfortunately the air Canada app has stopped. Don't bother to download.
2962,Everytime I try to use it It can not find any vacation packages for me. Try different cities and dates and still nothing available. Pretty useless for me.
2963,Flight info is good but the Rouge Player is inconsistent or nonexistent in how it works - very frustrating when you are on a 6 hour flight.
2964,"For 2019, this app is trash. It times out to easy. And, the loggin here is different than their web based site. not fun trying to check in party of 5."
2965,"Flight was boarding, still had not updated with my gate number or any information. Continually said ""Last updated yesterday"" when refreshed. pretty useless."
2966,Am missing being able to see loads
2967,Just install app got an error.
2968,"Told me I had to reset my password, did that and still wouldn't let me in. Changed my password 5 times and it still wouldn't let me log in. Very frustrating"
2969,80mb for this app?! what a waste of data and memory Wasnt able to checkin because my flight got cancelled yet ac did not advise me nor did the app explain the cause of the error. Disappointed
2970,"not working properly -- never got it to work properly, never allowed me to login, Doesnt work on my Lenovo Tablet."
2971,App hangs all the time. I constantly have to reboot. Much more stable on my iPhone.
2972,The app keeps appearing and disappearing in my notification bar and drop down menu all in its own. It's like a flash. Please fix
2973,"Bad app for probably the worst airline. Avoid Air Canada service, flights and loyalty if you can! This app can't use the check-in feature if your name has any letter in it that isn't Latin based from a to zed or has an accent on your passport"
2974,"Awkward, slow, horrible app. Customer service assumes that you are flying and nothing else. Had to uninstall to try to fix."
2975,"After the update, I can't retrieve my air ticket. I'm at the airport gate right now, which adds a lot of stress."
2976,Poor. Previous version used to work more reliably.
2977,"I already wrote a review, where did it go? This app is garbage and it's not acceptable in 2019. If the check in process is going to 15 steps long, we need to be able to log back in to edit information. Now I have to call and wait 1.5 hours on the phone. Jesus."
2978,"Wow. I'm truly surprised how terrible the app this. Use the website; it's faster, easier, and way less confusing."
2979,Keeps saying turn off airplane mode. Connect to wifi. My phone isn't on airplane mode and it is connected to wifi. Not able to use this app.
2980,"Doesn't show my seat number, doesn't show duration of flight, doesn't let me change seats, doesn't let me check in. Full of bugs. Useless app."
2981,Not impressed. Old App was much better.
2982,"86 Meg bloat. Tells me to reset my password because I failed too many logins (new phone, how's that even possible?, so I reset the password on the web via email, etc. Tells me to reset my password because I failed too many logins... So one star, Air Canada. Why does this app use an email for login ID yet the aircanada web site wants my Aeroplan ID. Complexity will bite your design in the rear."
2983,"What garbage app. Download the app to watch movies, then it crashes everytime you try. The ads before, no problem we'll play all of those."
2984,Entertainment App kept crashing after the ads played. Restarted a bunch of times wit exact same results. App stopped surprisingly after ads play
2985,"Without any doubt, this is the worst app in existence. Slow and totally useless. Fits the Air Canada slogan: ""We are not happy until you are not""."
2986,Used to work just fine! Been crashing for the past 3 weeks now and not being able to sign in or link my aeroplan account!
2987,"unable to reset password (no email sent both from app or website), unable to retrieve booking without getting an technical error message... you're a major airline company, cut 1% of what you pay your overpaid CEO and hire a competent app and website designer"
2988,Couldn't use the app to watch any movies it was like watching something that was on dial-up. It was slow and choppy
2989,"This app is terrible. You can't login with you AP account like you can on the website, and for some stupid reason the app defaults to US Dollars!!! You're a Canadian airline, how stupid is that? You can't make this stuff up."
2990,It's very strange that the login account here is different from the official website of air Canada.
2991,Same problem as others. Updated my password and now the app won't recognize me. Tried reloading the app and it fails to reload too.
2992,Please fix the password situation. The app worked great before. I changed my password multiple times.
2993,doesn't work very well... keeps sending me back to the start screen when trying to book a flight.
2994,"Constantly malfunctioning, requires reinstalling, but only fixes some glitches. New problem: can't get into settings!"
2995,"So many problems...AC needs to produce a better app, comparable to their competition...this latest version is near useless."
2996,"Ever since they were hacked, not only do you have to keep changing your password, the next time you go to use it it says your account is locked and you have to reset again. I AM ON MY 10TH PASSWORD CHANGE. I give up."
2997,Using 3x battery of fb and clunky. Kept asking me to sign in when already authenticated. Uninstalling until needed.
2998,"This is the most complicated apps of all world airlines, simply, always there is a problem somewhere especially password and access"
2999,I just want to check in using my phone but have to download this massive app. I don't have a lot of storage so it won't load properly. Please develop something that allows you to just check in.
3000,this app can never work. it keeps on asking me to remove from airplan mode or put wifi. I'm on wifi and still not letting me create account nor check flights.
3001,Does not have the ability to save the digital boarding pass to google pay which other major airlines have supported for a while.
3002,Didn't work. Good thing my tablet has the old rouge player. It works. Plays the commercials then crashes.
3003,"App continuously asks to reset the password and even though you reset it, is asks again. Same thing for Aeroplan linking."
3004,"Frustrated with repeated efforts to log in, even following AC's arcane instructions for web reset and still can't log into app!"
3005,"Really terrible app. Clunky, bad ui, and doesn't even let me check-in after being very slow and multiple attempts"
3007,"""network not available"". Um, yes I'm connected to my home wifi just fine. Useless"
3008,Other reviews sum up this unusable app. I wonder if anyone in AC has ever tried using it. Suspect it may have been developed by one of their competitors.
3009,App asks for all kinds of personal info but fails to supply it to any of the check in forms - truly stupid.
3010,Constantly syncing and using data even if I'm not flying for three more weeks. Slow as.
3011,The only major airline app that does not have a proper profile login option. AC at its best...
3012,"It just doesn't work. Check in is broken, keeps signing me out and seat changes don't stick."
3013,"Terrible app, terrible prices. No mobile boarding pass available to international flights. App is heavy - and for what?"
3014,The worst part of this app is it means you're flying Air Canada. Also boarding passes take forever to load.
3015,Nothing works.. takes an eternity to load anything. Completely unresponsive. Other Airline apps work perfectly fine.
3016,"61 megs and it can't even log in (""we can't log you in right now""). Hunk of junk. Avoid avoid avoid"
3017,"Tried to sign in. Getting ""Network not available"" while I'm on WiFi network. Does app really need cell network? Why it doesn't work on WiFi?"
3018,not usable. keeps saying no connection and to remove airplane mode. app is faulty and had to uninstall. useless.
3019,Very very low quality.
3020,Kept crashing and popping error messages across other apps even though it is not being used. Extremely poorly behaved app
3021,"it's ok, it's old and clucky not an app for 2019. but it works most of the time."
3023,horrible. cant log in because it wont connect to a network (mobile or wifi). a completely useless app if you cant even have it connect.
3024,"Can't log in, customer service says ""oh, we prefer you use our website, it's more reliable"""
3025,"Downloaded this app yesterday. But after multiple attempts I still can't create my profile to login, so I don't know how I'm supposed to use it for my up coming trip."
3026,Can load booking
3027,"In Air Canada website I can do login with Aeroplan number and pass#. But on the app, I can't."
3028,Just downloaded the app and it just crashes. There are a lot of complaints about this. Is anyone listening???
3029,always getting a no network message even though i am connected to wifi and all other apps are connecting fine.
3030,"Attempted multiple times to connect to Rouge inflight entertainment, not once successful due to apparent flaw in the application."
3031,Many failed attempts to log in. Many failed attempts to check in. Almost no support when I contact the Aero Plan.
3032,Couldn't even log in.
3033,"Unable to log in. Keeps getting the message ""Network not available"" even when I have perfectly working internet"
3034,App is terrible. Won't allow you to check in. Website does not work as well.
3035,App seem to constantly fail to connect to the server. Can't do anything.
3036,WORST APP EVER!!!!! They dont bother to update ANY of the information for your flights which results in missed flights. GARBAGE APP!!!!!!
3037,Cannot log in.
3038,"The single most frustrating app I have ever used...constantly freezing, or wheel of death / not responding"
3039,"When booking a return journey, does not gives option to proceed to select the returning flights, so pathetic!"
3040,"selected seats 5 times, saved and confirmed. went to accept policy and pay, bounced me out each time!"
3041,Can't log anymore something wrong happened to this app if so just let us know it is ridiculous to treat your loyal customers this way. Shame on you and your marketing department
3042,Air Canada rouge player does not work on my Galaxy S10+ . It is useless on a long flight to and from Europe.
3043,cumbersome reloads and.crashes frequently best of all recent reporting shows the app may be exposing my credit card for analytics...
3044,"Very poor experience on install, trapped in infinite loop of password resets on creating account makes app unusable."
3045,"Can't log in, says Network Not Available. Using web site instead."
3046,"Download on a Samsung S10 using Android 9 Pie OS. App says ""network not available"" when on data/network, on 2.4gHz or 5.0gHz wifi."
3047,"Too slow at updating flight status, could not use to check-in."
3048,"Worst app ever. Keeps logging me out and when I go to log in, it says my password is wrong. Stupid app."
3049,It does not start. The message says - unfortunately Air Canada has stopped.
3050,How many times can an app crash in a 10 minute span? Gawd awful piece of trash. Hope ACs planes work better than their app.
3051,"Not user friendly, glichy, times out often, often requires updating."
3052,update sucks. move the order of middle names so boarding pass would not match name on passport.
3053,Can't login.. Can't even try clicking on forgot password (though I know my password). Seems pretty basic
3054,Crashes a lot. Have to enter aeroplan number every time.
3055,"What's the point of this app if I can't book and pay for flights? Every time I try to pay, there's a tech issue. pointless download."
3056,Terrible reliability issues. Continues to fail at loading anything. Worst app I've used to date
3057,"""No network"" ""No network"" ""No network"" ... when there's clearly a network available. Unusable."
3058,Very bad experience. Can never login or link my aeroplan. Lots of bugs
3059,I wanted to use the app to check in for my flight. It wouldn't allow me to check in and gave no reason. So it was worthless for me.
3060,Nothing works. Can't check in
3061,Garbage app. Came back as no flights for a busy route between Canadian cities. Trying westjet now
3062,"I think an app with a million installs, belonging to a huge company, should meet a high standard and should not be a waste of my time. This app fails on both counts."
3063,Most airline apps I use allow me to use the phone as my boarding pass. I get an email that I have to print. What is your app for?
3064,"Ok, but does not remember your trip unless you are a member. so need to dig out PNR details every time you need to access your booking on the app."
3065,Cant even login because of their damn password recovery service. extremely glitchy and awful user experience
3066,Unable to create an account. The app thinks airplane mode is on... Utter garbage.
3067,"Not able to log in, always shows ""network not available"". Seriously?"
3068,"Terrible app, won't even show my seat assignments."
3069,Unstable. Keeps active in background despite settings and chews up heaps of battery. Better off without it.
3070,App crashes when you try to view your boarding pass.
3071,Your app sucks right now. I try to finish a booking and it logs me out doesn't go through I've tried this 10 times
3072,Can't use at all. Says network not available even though I am on wifi. Total waste of time.
3073,It is not responsive. Impossible to check-in on the app.
3074,Useless app. You get more options to book a flight ticket in their website.
3075,"Why allow a poorly designed app to tarnish your image. People have figured this out . It is not hard to get this fixed, maybe there is some ego in the way."
3076,Terrible application. Never able to check-in. Useless just like the airline.
3077,"App displays fares in US$. Why does an app downloaded in canada on an airline named air canada give fares in US$? Uninstalled, booking West Jet."
3078,App is very slow to load boarding information. Unusable in a rush
3079,"New changes doesn't allow for sign in, auto sync flights. Truly a garbage product."
3080,On the latest Android this app does NOT save your Aeroplan number which virtually renders the app useless
3081,"App updated today and I started getting notifications every few mins that it stopped. Uninstalled, too annoying."
3082,"""Retrieving your information"" seems to take forever."
3083,"Fundamentally useless, if the app cannot find my itinerary and load my e boarding pass then why should I continue to use this app?"
3084,I'm not able to retrieve the boarding pass so I have to resort to going to a kiosk and print the damn pass.
3085,On my last flight I was not able to use flight entertainment feature. After playing ads app crashes.
3086,Doesn't work for online check-in from Europe. I can't believe this could happen in 2018.
3087,Can't link aeroplan card. Keeps saying card already linked.
3088,Hangs. Won't connect to server. Can't log in. Rubbish app.
3089,Too bad it isn't compatible with my tablet. But why would I want to watch a show on a bigger screen? Clunky in some ways.
3090,All of a sudden constantly crashing today despite not opening it.....
3091,Requires you to download another app to work as intended but even then still doesnt work.
3092,It's scooping background data and syncing when not in use.
3093,"Ant plans to add maple leaf lounge membership as a digital card in the app so i dont have to remember my card every trip? Also, ever since the hack, i cant get tid of the passwors change popups, no matter how many times i change my password"
3094,"USD Im using an app for Air CANADA and it always displays prices in USD?!? Bad enough that it is the default setting, but changing it to CAD in the preferences still gives you the total in USD!! Looks like they want to give the appearance of great deals... What a scam!!!"
3095,"having several issues as its not loading the information, can't find my reservation"
3096,"I cant book a flight, getting errors? Kind of useless app now."
3097,in spite of having a choice between cellular and Wi-Fi connection it will still ask ya to turn off the airplane mode... Who wrote this app??
3098,Not improved usage over older version and forced update...
3099,could never get through the hour long download for android after uploading the Air Canada app.
3100,It's good but it barley ever works. Everytime I check in it messes up

Who then tells you to go to another counter, where then five (!) employees talk about stickers until you miss your flight. Then if course it's another $75 to change to the next one. Don't forget though, cant drop your bags so have fun sitting for hours doing nothing. The air travel is appalling."

3388,Please don't fly with Air Canada. I have worse experience. I am never recommend to anyone. Please avoid it if possible.
3389,How about defaulting the currency to Canadian dollars instead of US dollars.. as you know this is a Canadian company not an American one.
3390,Can't create account.
3391,Noy easy app
3392,Charges me in USD so I won't book flights on it until that is corrected.
3393,we booked a flight to got Saskatchewan the flight got cancelled because the plane tire blew. then we were supposed to leave the day after and they canceled that till 2 days later so overall air canada had ruined my only vacation with them.

3396,Duration is wrong for flights that have multiple time zones.
3397,"Epic failure, just one more of many"
3398,"Not an ap rating, a rating on the customer service I received at the San Diego airport."
3399,I will need to pay to watch movies and have wifi on the plane Ã°ÂÂÂ¥Ã°ÂÂÂ­

3409,rouge player never works so ZERO entertainment
3410,"Myself and 2 girls went to check in and realized one of my daughter's passport had expired (thankful we have Nexus) but custom border was close. Long story short, the check in clerk she (didnt have a name tag and I had forgotten to ask but supervisor's named was Dave) was sooooo accommodating and compassionate towards re-booking (for free) our flights, an extremely limited flight to St. Thomas, I actually was so calm and not even upset with myself that I cant travel until the next day. I was overwhelmed by the level of compassionate and understanding of the staff at Delta airlines. Thank you for making a frustrating human error and turned it into the best circumstances it can be. I am always grateful for you this situation. Thank you Dave and my check in ""angel"" at YVR airport. I am forever grateful of your generosity."
3411,OMG. I did it so on October 23 this was my very first time flying. Nervous is a understatement. I about crapped my pants. Not to mention i had 4 children under the age of 10 to accompany me. As i boarded the plane it was pretty much smooth even though I did not know what to expect. At take off my 5 year old daughter screamed her lungs off i'm sure scaring other passengers. As a mom I had to stay calm even though my heart was in my stomach. In the air i was a nervous wreck but it's not like I could get off. The turbulence omg omg omg it was consistent even freaked me out more.
3412,Once the flight attendant Kara and Jay found out it was my first flight they treated me so very well. They continued to check on me and my children. I had a couple drinks before i realized it i'm like what turbulence. If i could have tipped these two I would but they were not allowed to take tips. Kara and Jay you guys were awesommmmeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee sauce and I appreciate you all so so so so so so so very much and I wish them best of luck.
3413,"Our last 2 experiences with Delta have really helped restore my faith in humanity. About a month and a half ago, my wife and 6 y/o daughter missed their flight due to weather and terrible traffic. Long story short, they were put on the next flight. My wife asked if they needed her card number and the girl in customer service said, ÂWe're not gonna charge you.Â I almost fell over. A few days ago, there was a mix up in flights (again it was OUR mistake, not DeltaÂs). We were traveling with our 2 children and my mother in law. Luckily we called ahead to confirm. Turns out, my mother in law was departing out of a different airport. Again, they fixed the issue (the DAY before the flight no less) and AGAIN, didnÂt charge us. After these experiences, I would HIGHLY recommend Delta to anyone. Keep it up! Unfortunately, we threw the paper out with these awesome employeesÂ names."
3414,"Since 2009 I have flown to Philippines for personal and business purposes. After using multiple airlines, Delta comes out on top for superior customer service. The staff are clearly motivated, engaged, and interested in any passenger needs. I appreciate so much that about every hour or so there are staff up and down the aisles offering drinks and one can always go to the kitchen area for more if needed. And the meals and snacks seem to keep coming at just the right intervals."
3415,"Sadly the performance on partner Korean Air fails to meet Delta standards and on their flights I feel I'm dying of need for food or drink long before it's offered and the staff at the Korean Air gate act as if Delta ticket holders are imposters. I've been using Korean Air lately because I'm most comfortable with seat choice on the 747 and mourn the loss of that plane from your Delta fleet -- guess I'm just old fashioned but there is something irreplaceably comforting about a 747 4 engine aircraft with such an impeccable and decades long safety record. As a repeat flyer I would gladly pay extra for a Delta 747 seat to help pay for the higher fuels costs -- couldn't you reconsider its demise and offer it as a special option? Anyway, many thanks for your ongoing top performance and yes I will continue to fly Delta and partners."
3416,"Highly recommend, the best company, excellent in customer service. My daughter booked two trips next month from American Airline and Delta. When I did change today, the two companies response are totally different. Delta customer service is excellent, they respond to the phone call immediately, an agent on phone resolving the issue with a warm heart, do the best assistant me, you will feel the world is beautiful because there are beautiful people."
3417,"Amerian Airline customer service is horrible. It not just waiting for 30 minutes to get a response. Also the agent on the phone is heartless, Cold. The ticket is $1200. The agent refuses correction ticket, credit or refund. The flight schedule is a half month from today, make me total confuse, it is a conspiracy that big company (AA) cheater customers and take advantage of consumers. The response from Both Airline Company, The Result is: AA is the worst Airline Company. Delta is the best company, they are beautiful people and make the world a beautiful Place to live. Highly Recommend!!"
3418,"I only gave a 1 because that was the only option, otherwise I would have left that part blank. The caronavirus is everywhere. Nobody planned for this. My mother and I had booked our flights a while back and we are supposed to be going April 15th. We decided we shouldnÂt be flying even if everything is cleared up at that time. I just started a new job and was approved for vacation when I was hired. I will not have a vacation by the time their credit that they were offering was going to expire. We asked if they could make an exception and they wouldnÂt."
3419,"Pretty sad that other companies have refunded a few friends of mine that were supposed to be traveling. Even Allegiance refunded one of my friends. Delta is a very well known airline, youÂd think theyÂd care a little more about their customers instead of trying to hoard the money. Now I get to pay into their payroll and now also get to rent a car to drive down to South Carolina from New York. Keepin it classy delta, keepin it classy."
3420,"I bought tickets to Florida in order to go to a couple of spring training baseball games. When the games were cancelled I attempted to go anyway. Domestic travel has been strongly discouraged and I had to cancel. Delta kept 1/2 of the fees, $600, and credited me for the other $600 towards future travel. This was beyond my control, a global pandemic. I should not be penalized for this. Next time I will drive."
3421,My wife and I purchased 1st class tickets many months ago prior to the Corona-virus outbreak. My wife became very sick with a nasty sinus infection and as the Corona-Virus was in full swing many people began cancelling trips. I am close to 70 years old and felt it was not a good idea for my sick wife or myself to travel at this time. This was an unusual experience as I am sure it was for everybody. Our flight down to Nashville was with Jetblue. They immediately refunded our money with no problem.
3422,"When calling Delta it took 2 hours of waiting time to get through and a ridiculous battle to get them to refund our money. They fought me every inch of the way. They beat me down to a point that I finally took what they offered which was 100 buck per ticket which was a total of a 200 dollar loss. We felt that under these condition they would simply refund our money our of good faith. I will never fly Delta and would NOT recommend to anybody to use them. Remember my wife was very sick and the Corona-Virus was in full swing. Seems like it would have simply been the right thing to do. I received refunds from all hotels, and Jetblue with no problem at all. Delta, You have not behaved in an honorable way and people will not forget this."
3423,"The app worked great for awhile, but now I cant even look into booking a flight. If you put in an airport in the from and to sections, it stays blank. The number one feature, being able to book or check out potential rates and prices, is unusable. The app was never great, but if it fails to perform its primary function, then it is trash. Just use the website."
3424,"Showed up a few hours early trying to get on a earlier flight. I went and spoke to the person (Holly **) a asked if there were any available seats that I may get home to my family sooner. She stated that there wasn't. However, I hung around to wait till everyone boarded to take my chances. I waited and watched as she sat the 3 standbys and heard her state that she did have 2 more empty seats. At this point I asked again. She denied me because she didn't want to do the key entries to add me to the flight. I could understand if there were no seats but she simply did not want to do the extra few key punches. This is just ridiculously unacceptable. So you have empty seats and you just chose not to add me to the flight cause you didn't feel like it. Most disrespectful thing I have ever experienced. Won't be flying Delta again."
3425,"Spent the day on 3/12 trying to cancel a flight. Given the current climate, the hold time was 6 hours long. I was notified at 1pm that the event I was going to in Las Vegas was cancelled. Was able to easily cancel the hotel with no issue online. Sat on the phone for several hours to no avail. Tried utilizing the website but that did not work. Called this morning 3/13 sat on the phone for 2 hours. Finally got through to someone. I was told no refunds only flight credits... Flight credits for 5 people who will not ever clearly be traveling again. I get you are trying to stave off the tail spin of your stock plummeting, but do right by your customers. I frequently fly and was thinking of applying for your credit card. I already hold the American Airlines Elite card. But not after this experience. I also have time and resources to fight to get my money back and ""fend for the little guy"". I assure you, you went to war with the wrong person. :-) Delta **."
3426,"Please do not call to get information about changing your flight because of the coronavirus. I merely asked to know Delta policy should I need to change my flight due to the virus. After he told me about the $300.00 change fee he then said It must be done on this call or not at all. All I wanted was info and I told him that immediately. He said it was on this call or not at all. I am 79 years old and I thought I was being cautious but instead I got punished. He said they are not allowed to reveal that information at the start of the call. Very shady, very disappointed with Delta."
3427,Delta Air Lines was great. Their customer service was wonderful. My flight was great even though I missed it due to changes at the terminal. I recommend them. We should have more airlines like this.
3428,"We purchased travel tickets to Eugene Oregon, scheduled to leave on Friday. Layover in Seattle. Because of our concern over the Coronavirus our family as well as ourselves decided to cancel our trip. Delta refused to refund the ticket price because The Coronavirus did not meet their selected criteria for refunds. So they expect us to fly into a city where a good number of major companies have chosen to let their employees work from home, where the school system is contemplating closing schools, where 11 people have died from this virus. I guess itÂs all about the Benjamins."
3429,I called and spoke to several people needing to reschedule a flight for my son to come home from College on Spring Break. He play for the school basketball team and they are in the playoffs so he need to reschedule his departure date. I am not asking for a refund only to reschedule and I am being told NO!!!
3430,"I fly often Delta 2nd most. They have some issues and I am locked out of my ability to log in. I changed password last week and flew logged in several times since, now they locked me out of my Sky Miles, will not tell me why they have numerous ways to verify me even answer the phone addressing me by my name. They want me to post my driver's license to their site to be able to log in. They will not tell me why. Very rude and hr wait on their phone system when you call, their phone systems prompts do not always work and they are horrible 5 hours and have nothing to show for the wasted time. What company asks for you to send non secure a driver's license photocopy to book a flight. They have numerous ways to verify me even answer the phone by my name. They recognize my phone number, Have TSA precheck Delta credit cards etc. etc."
3431,"Booked flight with Delta online. Credit card shows pending but no confirmation with delta. Call them to enquire, they canÂt find the transaction but same flight is now $160,- more expensive (all within 2 hours). Delta help canÂt find transaction (even though they could charge pending amount to credit card). Bait and switch at its best...."
3432,"Booked flight through FlightHub and thought I had purchase full cancellation insurance, only to find out it was only valid for 24 hour cancellation. FlightHub told me I had to email customer service and that there would be a $50 off the top fee to cancel the seats and the rest of the refund would have to be reviewed before a credit could be issued. The flight was with Delta who had charged me for the tickets. So I called Delta and explained the medical reason for having to cancel and in just over a week, Delta gave me a full refund. Thank you Delta! I will now be reading the fine print closer when paying for cancellation insurance with any flight company."
3433,"Two of us booked flights from Las Vegas, NV to Idaho Falls, ID with a 30 minute layover in Salt Lake City. We were asked as we were boarding if we would check our carry on item as space was not available. We said ok. They told us to pick up our carry on bags in Idaho Falls (our final destination.) Upon landing in Salt Lake City we literally ran as fast as possible from the c gate to f16, the furthest gate possible! We heard nothing on the airport announcement system about our flight. We got there with time to spare only to be told by a 'ever so graciously smiling' counter woman. She called the pilot a jerk and said he closes the doors early and refused to allow us on that flight. Miraculously she managed to get our bags off the plane but couldn't get us on?? Yeah."
3434,"There were 0 flight options available to get us to Idaho Falls that fit our schedule. She gave us 2 $150 vouchers as if that would help. We rented a car and drove the 3 hours to Idaho Falls. The return trip was much smoother. I spoke with the customer service complaints and was refunded for the portion of the flight we were bumped from, received $200 in gift cards for other businesses and was refunded the extra cost of the car. Am I happy? Not really. It was inexcusable and stressful. My next trip will not be with Delta. The reason I gave 2 stars is because our return was ok and the customer service rep was nice."
3435,Immediately upon sitting in our assigned seats which were located in front of the seats with the emergency exits we noticed the seats backs were positioned in a straight up position. The backs of the seats were curved so our upper backs curved into them. The head rests pushed our heads forward so that our backs were in a C shaped position and our heads hung forward. After takeoff we discovered that nothing about the seats were adjustable. They were fixed in that position for the entire site. The position we were in was not just uncomfortable but very painful both to my neck and back as well as to that of my companion.
3436,I requested a seat change because there was a vacant seat available across and up from us. This seat was extremely comfortable. I do not feel the originally assigned seat was safe in the event of an emergency and was definitely not designed correctly. They should be removed. Better to have fewer seats that are safe rather than risk injury to cram in a few extra bodies. The other flights we experienced with Delta were positive experiences.
3437,"I should have arrived in Sacramento from New York 8 hours ago, but instead IÂm in the middle of the country being treated like cattle waiting to start the last leg of my journey. IÂll do whatever it takes to never use Delta again. They should be ashamed."
3438,"A month prior to booking a flight, we researched the best carriers for flying your pet. After reading multiple reviews, we decided to book with Delta. (I love flying Delta and have yet to have a less than stellar experience). My husband called three times to verify all the things needed to be done for our dog prior to our flight. We spent $300 for a pre-flight vet check, as well as purchasing a kennel ($109) that met the airlineÂs specifications. We were told to have him to Delta Cargo four hours before the scheduled flight. Upon arrival, the temperature was 19 degrees. We were told they wouldnÂt take him unless the temperature was 20 degrees, even with the required documented pet variance. We had to leave our dog with our daughter, hoping to fly him the following day."
3439,"My husband again called Delta Cargo and whomever he spoke to said there shouldnÂt be a problem getting him on a flight with the temperature above 20 degrees. Again, my daughter took him to Delta Cargo two days later and was turned away because his kennel was too small (the one we specifically bought for the airlineÂs specifications). They even told her Delta doesnÂt fly large dogs anymore!! After speaking with Delta four times prior to this, why didnÂt they even mention this!?! Save yourself a huge amount of stress and money! DonÂt even consider Delta for flying your pet!"
3440,"My flight from Las Vegas was late. Delta auto changed my flight assuming I would miss the connection. The app said D32. We were in A terminal in Atlanta. We ran through airport, caught train and ran to D32. Wrong gate. The attendant, Dan, was quite rude. He would not let me finish a sentence & kept repeating ""It is what it is. Go down the hall and get help"". Followed by interruptions to say ""go on now"". The app now shows my original gate with the new time. The help desk said D32, the app says c. We went to C thinking it had changed again. No, it has the original gate with the new flight at D32. When I approached Dan about the confusion he rolled his eyes, sighed and said, ""did you talk to who I told you to talk to?"" I was sent back to the help desk."
3441,"I am a Skymiles member and have flown for almost 20 years. The Delta app caused me to miss my flight, make me wait 4 more hours in the Atlanta airport, and the desk attendant was unprofessional and rude. A person commented ""If he doesn't like his job he should do something else"". We did not deserve any of this. I should be home already."
3442,The exit light fiasco. To start my wife and I require assistance to get to boarding gates at airports due to her knees and my COPD. Last year we flew Delta through FLL and found a very irritable Delta staff at D8 gate. We arrived at the gate in wheelchairs and decided to give them up and walk down the ramp to board the aircraft. When pre-boarding began we started down the ramp and was stopped by one of the staff and were refused preboarding because we did not have wheelchairs. This January 26th we were sent to gate D6 to board and the same group of staff were working that corner of the terminal so we knew better than give up our wheelchairs. Delta had put two departing flights in that corner of the terminal that would both board and leave at the same time.
3443,When it got close to boarding time naturally both gates filled with passengers to a point where both arriving flights had problems offloading. The staff lined up 18 wheelchairs at our gate including my wife and I. The mob of people was crazy and in a hurry to board as if it was first come first serve boarding. Our gate announced that there would be a 3-hour delay and our new flight time would be 4:00 PM. Delta needed a part for the plane and would have to be flown in from Atlanta to be installed. We along with 200 other passengers inquired about our connecting flights in Atlanta where we were flying too and where the part was coming from. Some were found other flights and some like us had to wait and were given alternate connections.
3444,"At 4:00 we boarded the plane and the ""EXIT"" sign was installed. Then the crew happened to remember after 3 hours that some of the luggage had to come off of the plane and be sent to other planes which passengers had been given. So for 30 minutes more they unloaded all the luggage, sorted out the few pieces that belonged on other planes and reloaded the remaining luggage. We were finally on our way to ATL. We arrived with 10 minutes to swap to our alternate flights because we had missed our original flights. The Delta staff member in ATL had only sent 12 wheelchairs all for baggage claim. People were scrambling to find wheelchairs but there was no one to push them in Concourse A. We were heading to Concourse E and did not even have wheelchairs on our alternate flight listing. We had now missed our alternate flight to BNA."
3445,"The attendant at the gate we landed at gave us another alternate flight to BNA via Concourse E. We had now 30 minutes to get to E and no wheelchairs. That's when a young girl found us chairs and after a while found another girl to help push us part of the way. They found another person to replace the other girl and we barely made that flight. Through the whole process, Delta employees just did not care about us. The employee in FLL did not process our assistance request and the Delta employee in ATL did not try to assist with transportation. Next time it will not be Delta that we fly."
3446,"Flied twice in 2019 summer with Delta, both return NY flights canceled, had to change my plans and return home on second day, being routed to another city to get home. So many flights back to NYC, believe Delta overbooked all flights. Their services were horrible, gave your seats in last minutes, when asked, let you check the black screens. Opened complaints after travels, got $25 back for each person for one flight, nothing for another flight. Two cancellations caused us a few thousand dollars additionally. It was so frustrating and helpless specially when you traveled with a big group with friends and families. Will try to avoid Delta in the future as possible as we can."
3447,"Damaged baggage procedure from the flight from January 2019 is never to end. What one should do to have it concluded. A seafarer has been dealing with this for a year now. Numerous e- mails, calls, misinformation that payment has been settled, but actually it has not, not followed up- time gaps filled with silence, family members being embarrassed over x visits to the bank and being sent back, precious work breaks spent resolving and chasing assistance, new account opened specifically for this case in order to do something from my side and still nothing. An ongoing nightmare with Delta Airlines over a single damaged luggage case. Disgrace!"
3448,"I travel as a family of 4 with 2 kids under 6 years of age. As a family we had over 400lbs of luggage allowance and we used less than half and yet the Delta staff made big fuzz about being 3-5 lbs above in a couple of luggages. So we had to bend backwards to redistribute belongings for 30 minutes. Then we get on the flight and we have again allowance to put 4 carry ons in the overhead bins and this century old attendant (just to give a sense of her experience without discrimination) gives us hard time, discrediting the allowance of the two tiny kidÂs backpacks and doesnÂt let me put my own backpack in the overhead. I tell her she is unreasonable and argue of my rights and she threatens to throw me off the flight!?! This is Delta, a crappy airline without sense of what service business is about and with personnel incapable of using judgement and reason."
3449,"I am traveling with my son who has a disability. We arrived at the airport very early on a connecting flight in 3 hours that is half empty. I asked to be put on this earlier flight due to a high winds advisory in my home airport and my son's disability, which makes long waits in a busy place challengings. I provided documentation from weather.com of this advisory. Delta loses nothing by putting me on this earlier flight and only to gain my customer satisfaction. However, their customer service agents refused offering no explanation. Teresa at Montego Bay was my last conversation and she was not polite or helpful. I have routinely made similar switches to an earlier flight on Delta and other airlines even when no wind advisory existed. I will think twice about using Delta again due to this poor service."
3450,"I booked a flight before the holidays and had to make changes, the online system would not let me so I had to call and have an agent cancel the flight. The refund never got posted to my account, which started a bunch of calls from my end and multiple agents trying to figure out what's going on. I have been given multiple conflicting stories and several apologies which still did not fix the problem. A part payment eventually went through and I had to call again and was told ""another department deals with this issue, call them"". So again more calls were made, this experience has taken close to 4 hours of my time over many calls to get this situation resolved. Delta should have much better safeguards in place for customers' returns of money. Being told that system errors are the cause are not good enough explanations and how many other times could this have happened to customers??"
3451,"Traveled from SFO to MSN (Madison, WI) through Delta. I had the connecting flight from Minneapolis?Saint Paul International Airport to MSN. Since my seat (flight DL 1309, departing at 8:40 pm from MN on 3rd of January 2020) was not allocated I went to the desk requested the woman to allocate my and my wife's seat numbers. She said she was working on that. After an hour I went back to the desk, she rudely responded back with a question, ""Did I call your name."" I was waiting for the announcement of my name and it never happened. She announced more than 20 people for seat allocation. After the Boarding announcement, I panicked and went back for seat numbers. She gave a rude look and printed 2 boarding passes with seat numbers different rows for me and my wife. When asked her she said 'thats all I can do'. I'm unable to conclude why such a bad treatment to me. Is this because I have a brown skin?"
3452,"We were scheduled to take Delta flight # 6196 at 9:10am from RDU scheduled to land at 11:26am in Ft. Lauderdale. Granted there were some weather related conditions, however our flight landed 5 hours late and we missed our cruise ship and thereby our entire family vacation for Christmas. Unfortunately, only 3 hours of the delay could be contributed to the weather as we had been told the final two hours of the delay that we could not take off due to missing crew, so the plane could not fly. Delta failed to keep passengers well informed and did not offer assistance to those that would be missing connections or their entire vacation due to the delay and lack of appropriate staffing."
3453,"We were stranded in Ft. Lauderdale upon landing and no offer of assistance due to their delay was provided by Delta. We personally contacted Delta upon landing and placed a complaint with corporate and have not received follow up or a response. Also, our agent at American Express Travel attempted to follow up on our behalf and she was told the Delta rep was Âsad,Â however the entire delay was due to the weather and it was unfortunate we were told there was an issue with the crew therefore there would be no offers of compensation by Delta for our missed family vacation. Totally unacceptable. We were there. The plane was missing crew or we could have taken off two hours earlier and made our cruise ship. That is not the weather, but poor management."
3454,"Delta ÂclaimedÂ to our Amex agent that again this was all weather related and Ft. Lauderdale was closed. Maybe at some point, however in the last few hours of our delay, we heard other Ft. Lauderdale flights being called and leaving RDU...just not ours. Would be helpful if Delta was upfront, honest, and assisted their passengers as opposed to shrugging their shoulders. Not cool and there should be offers of compensation made to ALL passengers on that flight for the horrible experience. We werenÂt the only family that missed the cruise ship on that flight and had their Christmas ruined."
3455,"Originally founded as a crop-dusting company in 1924, Delta is now one of the largest airlines in the world. Each year, more than 160 million travelers fly Delta."

3462,"I have the same general issues that most people have had. It loses trips just about every time I travel. When I try to reenter my info it can't find the trip at all. It also carries over to the website so luckily I screen shot my boarding passes as soon as i get them. Awesome idea, terrible execution"
3464,"This app worked great until recently. My phone crashes whenever I try to open this app now and even locks my phone up to the point of needing a hard reset. Once I uninstalled it, my phone works fine. Guess I'll have to keep in uninstalled until the issues are resolved as I'd rather have a working ph"
3467,"Generally 'stale', not dynamic app - fails at giving passengers up tp date info. Ex1; Does not provide or update gate information (even 30min from departure time). Ex2: cannot change flight for cancelation (though email points you to app to do so). Ex3: boarding card often reverts back to ""check in"" after you've done so - board pass unreliable when you need it."
3471,I like the Delta app. It has more options and is better than lots of other airline apps. The only thing they changed that I don't like is on the checkin it does not prompt you for bags. I always check one and many people do not so I can see why. Now I have to reopen it to check bags up front . I know I can do it on the kiosk but like to get done before I hit the airport.
3476,"The app works for booking and getting flight information but it has some serious shortcomings: to do anything it wants confirmation number every time you do flight anything. The confirmation number is not displayed on the online boarding pass, so you have to dig through emails to find it."
3480,"This app is a crash fest and I hate it. It makes the app completely useless in a practical sense since you should NEVER depend on it. It will crash on you and leave you stranded. Hasn't happened to me because I don't trust technology already, but I'm leaving this for anyone who is trying to be all in the 21st century and do everything mobile. The website isn't much better either."
3485,Rick
3489,"When it's working, it's great. Unfortunately, seems to not work about 80% of the time. Especially if you have connecting flights. Tracks the first leg fine. After that I start getting messages that my information can't be found and try again later. Once that happens you're screwed as far as finding your information. Doing an uninstall and reinstalling does no good. If you just want flight information it's pretty good, but if you want to track your information such as seat assgn. it's frustrating"
3491,"Delta's app and website are terrible. It never remembers your info even though you've checked the box to do so. Then once you've typed in the password; correctly i might add, multiple times, it doesn't work. Reset the password, doesn't work. I wanted to book a vacation with them. Got fed up and book"

3493,Take our two minute quiz to find the right Airlines for you.
3494,I downloaded this because I am visually impaired and was escorted to the wrong gate by the porter on my first flight. So my return home flight I wanted to make sure I was in charge. This app updated real time and kept me informed of where I needed to go. I loved the airport maps. Because of this I made my flight in less than 45 minutes by myself through Atlanta airport! Thank you at least to Delta app
3497,"Trips disappear. Every single trip I've used this app for, the trip has disappeared from the app at some point. Usually more than once. Then I need to find my reservation number and search for it again to get my boarding pass. This is very frustrating, it would be great if this was fixed up. Otherwise the app is very good."
3499,"Used to be good. It dropped out and asked for my username and password to log back in. I entered it but it said I got it wrong, so I went on with my computer and I was able to get in no problem... now I have to get the gate agent to print out my tickets. This just adds stress to an already long stressful day of traveling!"
3500,"Found a perfect flight, selected all my options, went to pay. Input all my information, and it told me I was missing some information. Nothing was left blank, nothing was highlighted in red. Tried 7 times, including starting over from scratch twice. Finally it gave me ""fatal error"" and lost my entire booking. Am not likely to use the app again."
3502,"So the app deleted my flight info after I got into the TSA with it and I had to scramble through multiple of their emails to find the confirmation code, which was link which opened the app but also still couldn't find my flight ... had to *manually* type it in...no prob but unnecessarily complicated to do it while YOU'RE TRYING TO CATCH A FLIGHT in a crowded airport. How bout instead of focusing on things you want people to pay extra for and make the app more user friendly."
3503,"Continually prompts you to sign into a Delta account every time you open the app. After continuing as a guest it's a game of chance whether or not the app still has your boarding pass or any trip information in it still. Do not rely on the app to have your flight information, keep it saved elsewhere and always have a printed boarding pass. Very bloated and not user friendly."
3505,"Average. I like it, like how it has the maps on most airports, but I HATE the fact that it doesn't remember my trip and every 3 times I go to pull up my trip- while in the airport or not- I have to look up my confirmation number because it doesn't have it saved. What's the point of having it if its usually easier to have a paper boarding pass and look at the screen in the airport to check flights, easier than memorizing my confirmation #!"
3511,"The app is awful! Have you ever been in a hurry because you had 40 minutes between flights, but then there were delays so you had 9? Well I have and just as I got to the gate the app decided to earse all my upcoming flight. I had to listen to a lecture about being more prepared However the biggest downfall is the way the use it. Don't send out an alert saying boarding has begun before everyone is off the plane from the previous flight."
3513,"Decent app when it works. The check in function has not worked for my last three flights. This is incredibly inconvenient. When I am able to check in, the app has a tendency to crash right as I need to scan my ticket. Helpful tip- screen shot your ticket if you are lucky enough to be able to access it."
3522,Really good app. But should have lower ticket prices like the travel booking site. Really don't see how Jacking up prices is good for customers. When you got 1000's of flights a day and puting stacks of cash in there pockets after overhead. But when you got Greedy shareholders who wants to stuff cash in their pockets. Well there's the answer to that question of mine. And the employees are first class all the way. To the staff. Keep up the amazing work that you do.??????????
3530,"The app has dropped my ""trip"" twice now, while I'm traveling with the trip... Forcing me to switch to paper tickets, when the app is supposed to eliminate that... Also it doesn't indicate TSA pre check... What is the purpose of an app if it doesn't even do the basic things its supposed to do... Ie show an electronic ticket with all pertinent information"
3533,What a horrible experience to have your boarding passes all loaded up then as you race to your next flight and you open this app to find the boarding passes are gone and you have to go hunting for your confirmation email or see an attendant. Of all the airline apps I use I have never seen this other than on Delta.
3535,"I've used the app for 3 trips, so far. At the end of two of them, in My Trips, my trip info had been cleared as if my trip is over. I'm currently reviewing this app while waiting for my bag. I can't use the app to find my bag, because the app thinks my trip is over. Edit: still useless upon arrival"
3536,Was not able to Check-in through the app for either of my flights. When I got to the airport it dropped all of my saved trip information and I had to reload it. I preselected seats for my return flight a week in advance and the morning of my flight they changed on the app. Do not even bother with this.
3541,"I'm logged in but it keeps forgetting my trip. I've put in my name and confirmation more than 5 times, my app remembers it for a few days or a few hours and then I have to put in all my info again. I'm flying out tomorrow and I will not rely on the app for my boarding passes"
3545,"Will continue to be one star until Google Pay support is added. It's basically functional otherwise, but no Google pay support is incredibly inconvenient and considering they support apples wallet app it's down right infuriating."
3547,"Delta is the best. I have access to Alaska, American, United, etc. I always compare prices and Delta consistently beats the competition on both price and value. Unfortunately, downgraded my 5- star rating, the wifi on the past two Delta flights hasn't worked after I paid $32 to access the wifi."
3548,Constantly resets and have to enter my confirmation number again and again even though the app should be able to find my trips based on my profile information. Boarding pass disappears every time the app refreshes. Not surprising since airlines in America don't really give a darn about customer service.
3550,"""Sorry, the app is having technical difficulties. Please try again. "" I tried everything ten times and it never worked. So I have zero functionality."
3553,"Strange that so many people are having trouble with this app, because mine works perfectly. I absolutely love it. It's a great travel sidekick and even keeps track of my bags. My favorite flight app, developed for my all time favorite airline."
3556,"Over the last few trips it asks me to check in, then usually tells me it's broken or I'm not allowed to check in because of my ticket type. Don't ask me to check in using the app if I can't check in using the app."
3557,"Terrible app. Its 2020 why do you still need my confirmation number to find my trips? Show me what I've booked already. Your app is terrible. Southwest can show me upcoming trips, why is your app so far behind? No funding? Do better."
3559,"Exceptional application, informs you of everything you need to know about your flight, baggage loading, boarding time and which gate your flight is arriving and departing. A++ One of the many reasons I fly Delta."
3561,It's Delta with a d not fly with an f when I look for this app. All searching by fly does is make me a annoyed. Tell the marketing genius who thought about that it doesn't actually trick anyone into flying more
3563,"Great app but 1 star because it keeps removing my boarding pass when I need it most, right before my flight. I have to keep adding in the conformation code. I'll give 5 stars once fixed."
3564,"Replacing humans. Delta is pushing this app as a convenience. But when the app says they cancelled your flight, and wait times are over an hour on the phone... How is this app helpful? Delta, we want to talk with real humans. Truthfully, delta appears best shamed into response on Twitter. Which is super sad... That only public lambasting can spur them to response. But at least there is a human on Twitter. Even if only one for every ten conversations."
3565,Never fails to lose my boarding pass once I get to the Airport. Make sure you screenshot as soon as it displays. Pure garbage.
3567,"Awful. The main reason for getting the app is the boarding pass. You get to the gate to find ""my trips"" is empty. What a failure!"
3568,Same issue as other people... The app doesn't save your flight info. When you open the app you have to type in the reference # and last name over and over again. Very silly.
3569,Disappointed experience - App refuses to let me login using credentials I updated on the website. If a user can login to one using a mobile device they should be automatically logged into the other.
3573,Does not remember trips on the app. Also the search function for previous trips to add miles does not work.
3577,"GET A BOARDING PASS. Not reliable, fails all the time. Your flights will falsely change on the application. Gives false boarding gates."
3578,If I could do 0 I would. I cant even login on the app; I have to go through the website to check-in. Very dissatisfying.
3579,Came back to rate 1 star. This app will delete your boarding pass at any time for no reason sometimes right at TSA. Today it was deleted at the gate during scan.
3583,This app is useless. My boarding passes arbitrarily disappear when I need to use them and as do the notifications as soon as I open them in the app. It is actually useless.
3585,"Won't allow me to login. I even reset my login information, nothing. Completely useless."
3587,App keeps dropping my trips and randomly my boarding passes. Really annoying when at security or when boarding.
3589,"Used to use this app all the time, but now crashes upon opening and doesn't work at all. LG V40"
3592,"Worthless, bidding pass disappears just when you actually need it at the gate."
3593,Locked me out of my account for 24 hours on an international travel day when I used valid login credentials. Ridiculous. QC -heard of it?
3598,Unable to log in on the mobile app even though I use the exact same login info on my desktop without a problem
3600,Was unable to use on Samsung Tab A. Every time I came to a drop down menu it would kick me back to the beginning.
3601,Useless app. never worked once nothing but problems.Had to just call them. Don't waste your time!!!!!
3602,"Terrible to find the flight,  information online at get instant results."
3604,Worst App again.... Automatically shuts down. What's up Delta? Don't want any more business?
3609,My flight information just dissapears during layovers when there's a delay.
3613,"This app just randomly loses your data, and crashes."
3614,Boarding passes only show up half the time.
