REVIEW,SENTIMENT
"Update : Now that the tech issues have been addressed, changing to 4 stars from 1 star earlier. The checkin functionality is great and also like to call out ability to view incoming flights, often 3-4 flights down. Need to have Altitude Status and progression integrated into the app.",Positive
Changing my rating since the problems are fixed in new update. Good work Air Canada.,Positive
App worked pretty much as expected. Could have used terminal maps to know where we were going for our next gate.,Positive
"Highly recommend when you travel with Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge or AC Express.",Positive
The app went from very useful to absolutely useless to useful again.,Positive
Finally fixed! Thank you Air Canada,Positive
I really like the previous interface. It was a big upgrade from the old app and yet the new interface had some welcome user friendly UI additions. What I don't understand is why some useful features were taken away such as integrating itinerary into the Calendar app and being able to change payment/personal info in the app rather than getting redirected to a browser.,Positive
"Since they moved to the new platform, the app has improved, but it now shows annoying messages about the need to update, which lead to nowhere, since Google store already made auto update. Otherwise, functionality is there.",Positive
"Loved the new app interface, definitely innovative and user friendly. The animations are quite smooth. Boarding pass details not only provides pure information but also gives flight status which is pretty helpful.",Positive
"Love the Air Canada app. Best one I have seen across all the airlines I have been on. Good UI/UX, and excellent view of flights info, boarding pass and my trips",Positive
"Much more user friendly than the old one, but still needs some tweaks.",Positive
Having access to everything I need in one place had made my travel experience second to none!,Positive
Love that you can track inbound routes. Simple but great.,Positive
Booking references not found? I can check my booking just fine on air Canada website so this app is not working. Update 27.2.2020 - it's working again. Hopefully it still works after future updates.,Positive
Flight details and boarding pass at your fingertips..,Positive
This new updated app has wonderful user interface. Got huge dicounts. Thanks buddies.,Positive
Easy to use and understand,Positive
No hassle app. Very smooth going...,Positive
"Most convenient , fast and helpful",Positive
"Still buggy.... unable to select meal preference (once selected in the app, the entire app shuts down), plus seating preference (window/aisle) has completely disappeared as an option from the updated app? Visually, much better looking though.",Positive
Love that you can track inbound routes. Simple but great.,Positive
Can no longer store altitude card. Otherwise nice update.,Positive
"good, but it should be better to be downloaded in China's app store",Positive
"So much happier with the new app. Haven't had time to really check the whole thing out, but had to provide some feedback.",Positive
Love this app! Gives you up to date status and provides everything you need at the touch of a button!,Positive
"Great flight tracking, schedules and app only features. Besides the usual schedules, alerts, booking, the are some nifty app only features like tracking the Inbound flight (know the chances of your flight getting delayed), view flight load and an offline boarding pass.",Positive
"Here is a feature request for the android smart watch (wear OS) version of the app. Please make the app force the display of the watch to stay on for at least 60 seconds when displaying the boarding pass. And also please display the boarding pass on first screen and allow to slide right to see fly detail. As the app is now, it's practically impossible to use as the watch always go back in ambient mode to soon. Best regards",Positive
"After december 10th update, app will not load. I get an error message now and the app shuts down. nice. I really need this app to work for upcoming flights, this is very frustrating for me, and, I'm guessing many others. Update...the next update fixed the shutdown problem and the app runs much better...thank you for fixing! Bugs were fixed, for sure, no troubles for 6 months or more. Thank you, again for fixing!",Positive
Great service always.,Positive
"I travel with Air Canada at least twice a month. About a year ago, this app was garbage. Now, it makes flying simpler. Period. If you fly Air Canada, use the app. 4 stars because room for improvement aesthetically and could use more seamless integration with tracking booked flights and calendar apps.",Positive
No idea why there aren't higher reviews for this app. Not a major fan of this airline but the app is so convenient that it actually names me want to fly more often with aircanada. Hoping this means improvements across the board for the whole company.,Positive
"Pleasent+easily read&understood app+helpful staffon ground+aboard. I enjoyed A C. this time around,and will reconmend it. No trouble on trip - I enjoyed these new airplanes>A320-200&B787-8Dreamliner-I did research on these planes.I was excited,and somewut impressed. Whitehorse-Montreal. Canadian Aboriginal Aids Network Conference-Aug 25-29,2019 recently.",Positive
good but i wish they improve the booking feature. i want something like cheapoair that shows live lowest fares when i hover each date in the calendar.,Positive
"Flawless, really. Added bonus to be able to track the inbound flight that will become your outbound flight!",Positive
Always great service. Accomadating every time I fly with AC.,Positive
"works great, a lot of improvements and ease of operation",Positive
It's fine but not the best and it would be great if you could save your boarding pass to Google pay,Positive
the app makes it easy to track flights.,Positive
Usually very easy to use and check in for all my flights,Positive
Very easy to use and a very well crafted design.,Positive
Excellent tool to stay on top of your flights,Positive
"easy to use, like boarding pass access",Positive
Wonderful App. Everything at your fingertips,Positive
Very useful app to keep one informed of essential travel information,Positive
Great and Easy App to use!!!,Positive
Works well and simple to use.,Positive
The new app is more user friendly,Positive
This app works great for me.,Positive
great app. occasional glitches but not bad,Positive
Very good airline,Positive
Fast and accurate flight information,Positive
"april 1 update, fixed crash issue",Positive
"Good app, info when you need it.",Positive
Very pleasant staff. landing were so smooth without drama,Positive
Great,Positive
"Surprisingly good app, very convenient.",Positive
Very useful and handy.,Positive
Very useful app,Positive
Good for in flight entertainment,Positive
Very Good app but need more updates,Positive
Does what it says,Positive
I feel it's next generation flight reservation app.,Positive
Works gud,Positive
Like having my flights at my finger tips,Positive
"This app did not work for me for i am not able to afford the cost of any tickets, as a black man. I have a son.",Positive
Great help for sublo staffs as well,Positive
Leo blamed me for this app's low rating. To counter his baseless accusations I'll rate it 5 stars.,Positive
Very User friendly,Positive
Was very happy and will use them again,Positive
works well with Samsung!,Positive
My dad made this app,Positive
great app no problema,Positive
Check-in from Florida to Canada App worked great. Was afraid to try after reading reviews.??.,Positive
One of the best airlines ever,Positive
Excellent went.I am travelling,Positive
User friendly App.,Positive
The new app is lit. Keep rocking,Positive
 love Air Canada. Are good people and very professional,Positive
Does what I need.,Positive
"don't use it that much, no opinion.",Positive
Easy to use,Positive
Works well so far,Positive
It's awesome,Positive
new experience is painless,Positive
very good thank you air Canada,Positive
is very helfull,Positive
not Too bad,Positive
good app actually,Positive
working again.,Positive
Extremely accurate,Positive
Not bad..a little slow. Needs better functionality of the check-in... Should auto populate the reference number like the old app,Positive
Optimal,Positive
Amazing app,Positive
Fantastic,Positive
Fast ,Positive
love it!,Positive
Seems to keep getting better. Try it again if you had issues with a previous version. Pretty good now.,Positive
I dont know what everyone is talking about. I was also affected by the hack and I was able to change my password. At first it didnt work but you just have to be patient with the app. The company gets hacked and now everyone is there giving 1 star reviews as if that is going to fix the issues that you have with not knowing how to follow the instructions that they give you. Its 2018 hackers are out there and things like these happen regularly. The company does it's best to protect your information but mistakes happen. I am sure all of you have made mistakes at your workplace. At least the company saw the problem and acted on it RIGHT AWAY. Only about 1% of us was affected by this. (Probably more) but they acted so only a handful of people were affected. The app is a great tool for anyone flying with air Canada.,Positive
This app was so helpful. I didn't have to use a search engine. I got all my flight info at my finger tips.,Positive
"I love the app and have no problems, they had a crash for a day and went back working fine... I bought my ticket last year via the app and they kept me up to date with notifications and all about every change and detail about my flight, I just bought my ticket with them and everything seems to be fine... With all that said it's very convenient for me ??",Positive
"I don't know why there are complaints. This app is slick. Provides clear status, seats, upgrade info, boarding cards. Great!",Positive
"I use this app every 2 weeks to book my hubby's tickets for work. Been using it over a year and no issues at all. However, would like to see the option to add travel insurance.",Positive
Its been decent so far,Positive
Good app overall. Just don't use auto update on it. It will lose your boarding pass when an update is performed. This happened to me right before boarding last week.,Positive
"This app lets me track multiple trips, flights, and boarding passes. Updating flights in real time. I love it.",Positive
Air Canada actually replied to my original posting and told me that the app could do this if you linked the accounts. This was not obvious to me so there is a problem there but it did work after I looked into it. The app does retrieve my information now. Way better. Thanks for responding. When a person signs in it should pull up their flights not ask you to submit tracking numbers - useless app - perhaps the writers should try using it.,Positive
"Honestly, I do not understand the huge ranting going on about this app. It is working very well, tracking my future flights, having my Aeroplan synced, etc. The features are working as expected and information is provided as expected. I am just removing 1 star for excessive unnecessary visual information... It can be simpler and even more intuitive for its purpose.",Positive
"AC can you tell me why I can't log into my account via the app? Works fine without the app. When I try to log into the app it says my email and password isn't valid. What's the point of having an app for convenience when you can't even log in. This is infuriating. EDIT: Thanks AC, that fixed my problem. Works fine now. ??",Positive
Would appreciate being able to provide feedback on particular flights through the application.,Positive
"This is a good app. Has some intelligent input features like auto-capping names and addresses. It's easy to book flights, to manage the bookings, and to check-in. It is easy to retrieve bookings and to view the boarding pass. This is one of the best flight apps I've seen.",Positive
Works like it should. I manage and book my flights including checkin and seat selection.,Positive
App was easy to use to check in. Used it to board the flight. App was timely of flight and gate changes. App still needs improvements to even stand with the other airlines such as Delta. They have checked luggage tracking where they notify you when your luggage is ready on the carousel.,Positive
"This app has come a long way since it was first introduced a few years ago. Those first few iterations were pretty useless. But now this is a very good app and I highly recommend it to Air Canada users. You can view your e-boarding pass, get flight status, and get notifications on flight status all from this well designed app. Kudos to Air Canada for keeping with this app and making improvements. Good job.",Positive
Works great for all the things it's supposed to. Checked in for all my flights and used the app to board my flights. Ability to make changes to a booking right from the app are great. Can a be a little slow to load sometimes when it's fetching fresh I formation. But overall very responsive and snappy.,Positive
"Great app, well setup making it much easier to track your upcoming flights, manage bookings, and makes it much easier to get from security to check-in to airborne.",Positive
Very slick and has everything I need to book and board a flight.,Positive
great app...0 issues since having this app....love it,Positive
It does everything I want an airline app to do. It's intuitive and easy enough to use.,Positive
"Great app if you fly allot. I feel sorry for all the complainers on Google Play reviews. My answer to them, "" aw, muffins""",Positive
I booked my flight and preregistered for my flight with this app no problem at all. Also have very easy access to my boarding pass.,Positive
"Smooth app, however, when viewing booked flights, flight duration doesn't take time zone changes in to consideration.",Positive
Recent updates are a significant improvement,Positive
Well this app is nice but it can get really annoying and it takes a long Time to find the good movies and I am 11 years old and I like horror Movies so add horror movies and I will delete my comment and rate It 5 stars.,Positive
Excellent work! Love the standby and import booking features!,Positive
"Saying network not available... while I have full WiFi signals Edit: got replied, thanks. It's issue with Android system webview. Why not to include such helpful information in the error message? At least I can try this app now. So increased to 3 stars. Edit2: I was not able to notice any important note on somewhere top during the frustration... Please show/pop it when users need it, such as in the error message, rather than let us check the network... misleadingly. But one more star for the CS.",Positive
"Just moved from BB OS10 to Android. The bb10 version was a ported Android App but was a bit more stable and connection was much faster. As for the app itself, it is very convenient for the frequent flyer. Love the standby and upgrade list function. Ability to book flights is straightforward.",Positive
I used this app and worked great and would have given it a 5 star until I upgraded it recently. Lost all my flight information and reservations and cannot retrieve this important information for my return home. I deleted the app and reinstalled it with no success. This leaves me stuck as can't use telephone for air Canada and they have no email to confirm flight information. This is very upsetting to say the least. Richard,Negative
"Horrible. I tracked a flight from last Saturday, and because they use the same flight number regularly, I am now getting notices about this week's flight. No way to delete it, or another flight number that I entered incorrectly. Had to uninstall and reinstall (because that's the only way you can track their flights). Total garbage.",Negative
This is the worst app I've ever used. It won't let me add boarding passes for an existing reservation and checked in for. It would not let me finish the check in process and I had to use the website on a laptop instead. What's the point of offering the app if it's useless?,Negative
"This app sucks so bad that you should consider using west jet. Every second booking the check in is not working, not on the cell phone or i pad. I will consider not flying air canada anymore because of there failing app. Convinence out the window back to old style check in.",Negative
Honestly if I can give this app a zero I would. Nothing but frustration with Air Canada and Aeroplan credentials. I travel often with many airlines and this app has to be the worst. The user interface absolutely useless. So frustrating.,Negative
Worked well until november changeover in software - never works now - need name and booking reference number to do anything - why cant they use flight number or aeroplan number as well - who carries their booking refernce number? Useless app now.,Negative
"This app NEVER works. All you get is ""sorry an error has occurred. We hope to resolve this issue soon. You can't download your boarding pass or check your flight status",Negative
"Tapping ""continue"" button twice causes failure. I was unable to check-in using app. After I checked-in at air Canada web page I cannot add boarding passes to the app.",Negative
You went from being a useable app which allowed you to basically check everything about your flight to basically a bloated app that points to your website. Worst is you are forced to update the app!,Negative
Doesn't work. Keeps giving me an error message every time I look up my flight. I have installed and re-installed several times to no avail.,Negative
What a garbage app. Doesn't update any information (Gate.. seat ) and it keeps giving me an error when adding the boarding pass. Such an embarrassment,Negative
"Like the other reviewers, the app is very difficult as every step taken results in a message informing me that the session is no longer available. Check-in online is easier but another barrier is the app is not compatible on any Samsung device (not available for download to our Samsung tablets from Google Play). This is not good if you have kids!!!!",Negative
"Your app is as bad as your customer service. Absolutely garbage. Will not get another dollar from me after throwing up error codes, and TRIPLE CHARGING ME for a single ticket. And not even giving it to me. Then sitting on hold for 3 HOURS, WHILE OFFERING ""GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE"" figure it out",Negative
"Has some good features. Tends to crash. The low rating is from the crash that occurred at the critical moment of check in whilst sitting in a remote, non-english speaking, foreign (from our perspective) country.",Negative
"Sadly this app is close to useless. Air Canada used to provide information such as what gate your flight is at, but now nothing that is not on your original ticket, keeps prompting to check-in for flight, but I have.",Negative
Liked the old version. New one can't find my flights to check in most of the time and when it does usually says it failed check-in but seems to have worked anyways. Need to have standby / upgrade and track inbound all linked to boarding pass instead of having to go through multiple menus each time to look,Negative
"I am now in Dutch Carribean and AC website wouldn't let me check flight status for my outbound flight! As soon as I get to AC website, I get a pop-up blocking the screen that travellers from this country have to contact AC reservation... What about Canadians who are here on vacation and what flight status has to do with reservations? Whoever designed this website is an idiot! The Android app is no better, as soon as I start the app it forces me to upgrade and doesn't let me use existing version.",Negative
"Constantly issues. Mobile checkin doesnt work, always crashes, in flight demands doesnt load and recommend to change plugin mid-flight which cant happen. No advance seat selection can be made or eupgrades. The only good thing are the email and mobile nofitications",Negative
"Downloaded this to check in, only to discover it times out on every attempt! Going to check in using an internet browser instead. Keeping this useless app just in case it notifies me of delays or cancellations (doubtful: won't even let me check in)",Negative
Cannot get this stupid thing to work right. It keeps apologizing for errors but doesn't fix them,Negative
Previous app had calendar integration but this version does not which kind of defeats the purpose of having this app.,Negative
Like the new interface however it keeps crashing on my S10+ with Android 10. Only uninstall + reinstall fixes it.,Negative
"Doesn't show you what terminal you are supposed to go to in the Trips section of the app, you have to go to the boarding pass section and it's annoying af",Negative
Barely passable as an app. Almost no functionality.,Negative
Looks alright but there is pertinent information that is no longer available. Digital altitude card doesn't seem to be an option anymore and when you click on your flight if it's going through the states used to inform you if you needed to clear customs. I'm currently going to Vancouver then Las Vegas from Calgary. No idea anymore where I'm going to customs.,Negative
"There are a few things you'd like expect this app to do well 1) Get to your boarding pass....Nope. most of the time I need to click more, boarding passes, then select the correct one (it shows all old ones). There is no easy notification direct to the boarding pass 2) Show your AC status....nope. Nowhere to be found. This caused me an issue when asking a lounge to print me a new boarding pass. They wouldn't without seeing my status... 3) Check in...nope. Most of the time it's missing",Negative
"The app has taken an enormous step backwards in terms of functionally, design, and performance. Why cannot I edit the features of my flight booked through air canada? Why are boarding passes no longer automatically generated? Why is my name misspelled in the app? On Galaxy S10+ the scrolling animations stutter , menus lag ,and the general aesthetic of the app is visually unappealing. How can this be possible? What exactly was wrong with the previous app? This app feels and runs like its 2009.",Negative
"How do you check-in!? Without going to the more options section? It's under the My Flights section, but if you stop checking in and try again later it doesn't show the option to check-in. How useless! Also it doesn't store CC data for faster checkout when booking a flight. I'd like to see that feature brought back so I don't have to have my card with me when booking a flight. Overall nice looking app, not great function.",Negative
"New app. New teething problems. Want to add your boarding pass? It's hidden in the more section. Which btw does not work today. Hopefully soon? App says my phone number country code is wrong and go into the web to fix it. Except it's fine and in the profile. Clearly QA failed to check data parsing. The previous app was great by comparison. AC, you need to test and beta your code more before throwing it over the wall and on your customers heads.",Negative
"What happened to the app? It feels as though half the functionality has been stripped out - I can log in to my Aeroplan but other than setting my personal information, what is the point of this?",Negative
Won't show arrival terminal nor seats assigned which is fairly useless.,Negative
"Was able to find my itinerary. After opening the app though it forgot everything and now it can't be found again. Tried signing up through AeroPlan hoping to add it online - very slow process, up to 30 minutes for a verification code?! And wasn't able to find the flight info anyways. Don't understand the value of any of these tools.",Negative
"App was ok till the last update. Unable to sign in so does not allow to link flights booked. Unable to add altitude card details so boarding passes do not carry Altitude Status .. UX is going down .. Edit 1 - The new app sucks at levels new even for Air Canada. The QA should really should ask for money back from his/her school. Cannot check in, cannot import boarding pass if checked in online, no connectivity to Altitude Plan. Please plant a few trees every week for use of paper boarding passes.",Negative
"The new interface is terrible. It has forgotten all of my information, doesn't automatically pull my bookings, etc. So far I've been unable to check in for my flights since the app was changed and have to check in on the web from my desktop or at the airport.",Negative
"Notably less useful than other airline apps. App required me to input record numbers for check-in and for boarding pass even though I was logged in and it should know what flights I have. Also, the check-in process failed repeatedly. Dev team needs to focus more on UX.",Negative
"The new Air Canada app loses most of the features of the app it replaced. The only saving grace at the moment is the app responds much faster now, probably due to better coding and integration with the new reservation system. When all the features return it will be better.",Negative
Check in is not working on the app since the last update. AC staff at airport counters have mention many traveler have the same experience.,Negative
"Just go to the mobile website, this app sucks. Wont let you check in, boarding passes work once in a while. It's just a slow goofy, semi functioning app. If they made some tweaks and things worked properly, it would be a great app",Negative
"Many options on the app, unfortunetly none is working. Always receive a message : ""sorry it's embarassing but this option don't work"". Well at least you try but next time try to put more effort in the funtionality and less in emoji in your error message",Negative
"The new app seems to constantly lose my boarding pass for return legs. Whenever on a trip, I can only ever get access to my outbound boarding pass even though it may be from several days in the past.",Negative
Horrible app since update....cant enter my aeroplan number. Every time i try to enter the number it logs me out instantly telling me to log back in and it does the same thing over and over again.,Negative
"Useless app. If you want to do more than just view your itinerary and have an electronic boarding pass, forget it, just use their website and save yourself your storage space.",Negative
Updating to the newest version wiped out all of the flight info I had saved in the previous version. I had to find all the reservation numbers and reload them all in the updated app.,Negative
"6 month ago I gave a 1 to AC app, it was a mess.... Now it's getting better and better and I use it daily without any problem. Still slow and the waiting should be manage better. Next step the visual which is minimal. Keep it up",Negative
"The flow is completely wrong and unintuitive. Check-in and boarding passes under ""More"", Really? Notifications now limited to one option. All or nothing choice. And calendar integration, disapeared? Or just just hidden many layers down in a menu item. UPDATED to 3 starts from 1 because of improvements described below. Calendar synch is half there hidden a few layers down but has to be trigged manually for each trips. Still not intuitive.",Negative
Their User interface is not the best but it works... Most of the time. Just to be safe always print your boarding pass. Also screen capture you boarding pass. They should explain it abit better. The app is tied to your account. Both have to match in order for it to work well. The app works but it is not very intuitive.,Negative
Pretty good app but I find it ridiculous that it orders boarding passes with the oldest on top. I have to scroll through many old boarding passes to get to the one I need,Negative
"Would think that you can add Star Alliance loyalty program number, not everyone wants Aeroplan points..... Also can't add reservations ... Need to fix this.",Negative
UPDATED: March 17th. Finally can add existing reservations. Let's give it a month and see if it gets more than 3 stars.,Negative
"Is there any way I can select the seat from the app before check-in? The seat selection feature was there in old app version, but I cant find it in the new app version.",Negative
"Over all good but, could be better for sure..",Negative
I was surprised to see that there was no biometric authentication option in this new update(Nov 2019). I wish they bring it back! Should have more than just three airport maps or atleast list all the lounges and AC facilities around the globe with an option to purchase one-time passes in the app. Integration with Google services like Google Pay to store the boarding passes and Calendar sync for trips. The developer should also consider combining the Rouge Player app with this one.,Negative
"The new app is not pleasing, I was asked to be a participant in the beta but the download never worked in the first place. The old app was great either but I'm hoping that there is some upgrades in the future. Integration with altitude is Zero it seems. Not sure what the big plan is for the future but I hope we step it up a bit.",Negative
"App requires start through the Google Play only. No indcation of altitude status. It would be helpf to have status indication instaed having plastic card. - helpful to have indication of gate for boarding; luggage carousel when arrived. - also would be cool to have boarding started notification and also an option to identify yourself (fot example when boarding already started, but you still have distance to walk to the gate...) - Indication of check-in/luggage drop-off counters would be useful.",Negative
Missing the time until next flight (hour and minutes) on the new app.. the old one had it and it was great when you had delays and tight connections. This information should be located on the first tab when the app is open. Please add this feature back,Negative
"sorta ok but some procedures aren't intuitive. looks like programmers never 'test drove' this thing. and AC is VERY slow in announcing flight delays & cancellations,lll & equipment & gate changes. WITH DUMB NOV 2019 APP UPDATE CAN ONLY SEARCH FLIGHTS UP TO THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE!!!!",Negative
This new update keeps crashing. Really great news for me as I have a flight in 6 hours and can't retrieve my boarding pass. Well done AC.,Negative
"Latest version of the app (v 5.0.1, 2019-11-15) force closes immediately after opening app. App is currently unusable. Using a Pixel 2XL on Android 10. Please fix the app.",Negative
"The new app looks like a great improvement, all except one huge issue. It does not bring over previously saved trips. Huge annoyance, that is a easy fix for the developers.",Negative
This version of the app seems to be a shell of it's former self. It works maybe 1/2 of the time.,Negative
App is negligible in quality since update. Used to show gate and relevant info but not anymore. Please consider a valuable update that is beneficial to the user community,Negative
There are continued bugs with partner elite status not being recognised and seat assignment issues.,Negative
Not saving trip bookings have to re-add every time i assume it will impact flight notifications,Negative
It should not take 3 taps to get your boarding pass.,Negative
It still does not look finnished. It has no flow to it,Negative
"So the new update now deletes my address and credit card number every time. Huge pain. Please fix. Really big fan of bringing the calendar sync option back. Thank you. That really helps with my planning for conference call and also looking back to see which cities I was in on which days. Love to see the calendar info include a little more information like the terminal number, maybe the comments could show the recommended check in times. Good progress.",Negative
The old app was better and had better functionality,Negative
"I use this regularly to show my boarding pass, but this app is very unstable. The looks have improved a lot through the ages, but not performance.",Negative
"Not sure what has changed recently, but this app no longer sends digital boarding cards via text or notifications. Also what really has me disappointed is the Air Canada app for android wear os no longer works and has disappeared off the Google Play Store. The wear os app was extremely helpful with the availability of having my boarding pass on my watch, notifications of flight changes and count down to boarding displayed along with gate number. It's all gone. Please make this available once again as it was such a great traveling tool, especially for people like myself that travel very often. Please make compatiable with Fossil Q Explorist again",Negative
"the app will say it has no connection if it is sent to the background and brought back again. as far as Air Canada is concerned, i will not be flying with them again. on international flights they make you pay for your luggage. if you have a long layover, they make you get your luggage and re check it and make you pay another fee. so for 2 suitcases it cost me 240 dollars each way. 120 each time we had to check in our luggage. i will stick with air new zealand.",Negative
"While waiting as a restuarant for my order, I had to change my Air Canada account password to confirm my booking, so when I changed it, it brought me back to the original booking for me to confirm. When I confirmed the booking, I choose my seat on the flight and only then had I realized that changing my password had brought me to two different bookings for the exact same flight and date had been both confirmed. I was left with $9 on my bank card and was humiliated trying to explain to the waitress at the restuarant that I couldn't pay for my lunch because this app had double booked and double charged me after simply changing my password. Please fix the app so the same humiliation doesn't happen to anybody else? Still waiting for my refund to go on my bank card...",Negative
"I'm having issues recently. The error I get is the app doesn't connect to a network whether it's wifi or phone network. Tried installing the app multiple times, same problem. Cannot connect to network. Please help.",Negative
Some things work well. But the chekin process is full of bugs. Seats won't carry to flight. Group notification will ONLY take the first person. Changing a person checkin will auto assign individual notification using another peraon's email. And I'm just getting started. A little QA wouldn't hurt.,Negative
I am disappointed with this app! good thing i had screenshot my boarding pass. Went to the airport and went to the original gate only to find out that they have switched to another gate. I could not get this new information because every time i click to view boarding pass app crashes.,Negative
