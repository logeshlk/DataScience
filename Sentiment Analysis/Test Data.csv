Review,Sentiment
"The app worked great for awhile, but now I cant even look into booking a flight. If you put in an airport in the from and to sections, it stays blank. The number one feature, being able to book or check out potential rates and prices, is unusable. The app was never great, but if it fails to perform its primary function, then it is trash. Just use the website",Negative
"The app used to work very well. Recently (since Jan 2020) it is prone to glitches and ghost notifications. Check in gets stuck and abandon the app to check in on website. If first leg of flight requires checking in on partner airline (KLM) the app won't get past the check in and is worthless for the rest of the trip. Baggage notifications work, so 1 extra star for that. But other ghost notifications are annoyances. Attempts to work out issues with Delta chat reps had no solution. Bummer.",Negative
The app crashed right before I had to scan my boarding pass. It also wiped out all of my trips. Tried logging out and could not log back in. Tried resetting password the email arrived 15 minutes late. Your password cannot be the same as the last one! I just tried logging in with but it told me it's invalid. Anyway after logging back in my trips are still not showing up even though I see receipts for them.,Negative
"Delta's app and website are terrible. It never remembers your info even though you've checked the box to do so. Then once you've typed in the password; correctly i might add, multiple times, it doesn't work. Reset the password, doesn't work. I wanted to book a vacation with them. Got fed up and booked through a different airline. Stay away from this catastrophe. I'd give it zero but that's not possible unfortunately.",Negative
"Really cool app. Used it for my trip to and from hawaii. Has maps of the airports, automatic tracking of your bags, gate updates, and departure times. Only hitch I had was it kept losing my flight and I haf to re-enter confirmation info over 10 different times which can get tedius/annoying when you don't know where the hell you are. Great app otherwise.",Positive
"The app works for booking and getting flight information but it has some serious shortcomings: to do anything it wants confirmation number every time you do flight anything. The confirmation number is not displayed on the online boarding pass, so you have to dig through emails to find it. Then the app forgets it anytime you need updated flight information (gates) if you leave the app. You can purchase checked bags but it doesn't remember the purchase or offer the receipt for expensing.",Negative
"The app has worked well in terms of keeping me immediately updated of flight changes and luggage status. Unfortunately, it can't fix Delta's terrible track record I've had with them, which meant needing multiple notifications. When a flight needed rescheduled, the app came short by requiring to rebook all legs, without giving the option of only changing the connecting flight. As a result, alternative flight the same night got full by time got through to customer service to change to it.",Negative
"I have used this app for years and never had any issues until recently. TSA Precheck is not showing on my mobile device boarding pass, but it does show on the paper boarding pass when i go to the counter and have them print it. I have had this problem with the past 3 flights in a row.",Negative
"Works well most of the time. Would be better with an option to read your password when typing it in, as on the website version. Would also be better to automatically save the boarding passes to the phone such that it is not necessary to login and have web access to find it again",Positive
I like the Delta app. It has more options and is better than lots of other airline apps. The only thing they changed that I don't like is on the checkin it does not prompt you for bags. I always check one and many people do not so I can see why. Now I have to reopen it to check bags up front . I know I can do it on the kiosk but like to get done before I hit the airport,Positive
Logged me out multiple times while at the airport. Had a problem where my flight arrived late and it wouldn't show my originally scheduled connecting flight. It only showed a new flight that I could switch to. Had to look up the flight and gate info manually. Gate staff assured me that I still had a seat on the flight and that my checked bag would make it on the flight as well. Luckily I didn't accept the new connecting flight like the app made me think I needed to do before I talked to the gate,Negative
"Good app....when it works! I have already checked in for a flight early tomorrow morning, but now the app tells me I ""have no upcoming flights"" and "" find my flight"" can't find my flight. Not the first time this has happened. Restarted the app numerous times over the last 2 hours..still not working.",Negative
"One of the best airline apps I've come across. I'd still suggest taking a screenshot of your boarding pass or better yet, printing it on paper as a precaution, but I've had no problems with it and I've used it for every function. The boarding notification is also very useful.",Positive
I used to use delta app 3-4years ago and it was great. Recently started to fly them again and the app won't keep me logged it or pull up my flights unless I use my record locator each time. Very frustrating.,Negative
"When it works it's fine, but frequently loses track of upcoming trips. Frustrating when you're about to board and suddenly no longer have a boarding pass.",Negative
"Poor for real needs. You think this apps main purpose is to tell you what your travel plans are and show you your ticket that you just checked in with (and check in before arrival to airport, but that's a failure too) but the app fails more than half the time. It's more frustrating to use. Just expect to use a hard copy ticket to be safe. Now, don't say I didn't warn you! Delta itself is great; it's just a bad app.",Negative
"It never works!!!! Everytime I attempt to open the app just shuts down. Which defeats the whole purpose of the app. I can't book flights, I can't check-in, I can't use to scan my tickets which means I know have to have a paper ticket. I can't do ANYTHING!!! I have updated, I have uninstalled and reinstalled, nothing works! Someone please fix because this is crazy and very inconvenient",Negative
Why does it not show my purchased trips if I'm logged in? Why do I have to search for confirmation number etc. Such a dumb app. Where is the flexible dates option for booking flights?,Negative
"Nice when it works. But just doesn't load my boarding pass for same day flights majority of my travels. I have to go through their website and manually type in my confirmation to have it text to me. Might be an issue with Android specifically I'm not sure. Has happened with all my devices, so I know it's not a particular phone.",Negative
"App still doesn't remember password, and makes me reset password almost every time I try to log in. Probably the worst travel app I have ever used by a major airline or hotel.",Negative
"Sometimes when you checkin on scan your boarding pass for a connecting flight, it removes your flight itinerary. I checked last night and now I have to refind my flight because it removed it. Last week after scanning my boarding pass to get through TSA it removed my flight from the app. Other than that it works, but that's an essential part of the app.",Negative
Garbage! What is wrong with these people at Delta? How can it possibly be a good idea to disallow access to my upcoming flight info within the app? I have to go over to my email to retrieve a confirmation number every time? What? Get a clue guys! Wake up!,Negative
"Beyond irritating! App erases your current trip/flight when flying across time zones from East to west, if your flight lands at 2300 and the phone is using plane time which is plus one or two hours. If you want information about the flight you are still on, then you have to manual enter confirmation numbers!!!! You would think the app would keep your current trip for at least 24-48 hours or one or two hours after you have landed local time.",Negative
"Sheesh this app is frustrating. I use this app BECAUSE I'M FLYING, focus on THAT. As others have said it frequently loses your trips requiring you to reenter you confirmation number/credit card/ticket number. It throws errors constantly. Highly unreliable. Frankly, if you can't get it right for those already flying why in the world would I trust your system to book/buy something else? There are a thousand ways to buy what I want, start by getting it right for those who are already flying.",Negative
"This app made my first time flying in years much easier and about hassle free . Lots of notifs and updates on flight details, let's you know when it's boarding as well !",Positive
"In fairness, I still can't judge accurately, but I'll try again to see if the app still restarts after I manually Force Stop or hibernate it from a utility app, adding to the drain on the battery. Might uninstall & reinstall when needed. To Moto G5+ users w/Oreo 8 & 8.1 who reported this app useless after upgrading, Thanks for the warning. Android 7.0 stays on this G5+. Oreo ruined my other G5+'s personalizations????",Negative
"Trips disappear. Every single trip I've used this app for, the trip has disappeared from the app at some point. Usually more than once. Then I need to find my reservation number and search for it again to get my boarding pass. This is very frustrating, it would be great if this was fixed up. Otherwise the app is very good",Negative
"Found a perfect flight, selected all my options, went to pay. Input all my information, and it told me I was missing some information. Nothing was left blank, nothing was highlighted in red. Tried 7 times, including starting over from scratch twice. Finally it gave me ""fatal error"" and lost my entire booking. Am not likely to use the app again",Negative
"For the amount of dependency they're expecting users to have for this app, it is extremely unreliable and complicated to use. 2/18 -- Downgraded my vote again with this app. It is the least dependable app I have ever used. Constantly crashes. Locks you out and no one at Delta can help you when your in a hurry. Which naturally is when this app decides to screw up.",Negative
"I am traveling with kids. Upon landing a push notification shows the carousel number. I click it, the notificatio disappears. The app opens but does not show the notification. Notifications section io theapp is empty. Moreover the whole flight is gone as historic. Aparently, creators always offboard in 5 mins and never traveled with kids",Negative
"There are some pretty serious design flaws. Their programmers don't seem to want to cache data ; if you lose connectivity, boarding passes can disappear. Seriously... It's an app for a location that frequently does not have Internet access? Why design a point of failure that's in one of the primary",Negative
"App loses upcoming trip info constantly. Then have to input confirmation number again to get the trip back. Not good when using it for boarding pass and in line to present to TSA. Also when adding trip to your account, it won't take into account your Known Traveler Number that is already in your profile, which means no TSA pre-check for you. App and system built by amatuers.",Negative
"After the recent update it had signed me out. Normally that wouldn't be such a big deal, but I am unable to sign back in, I am unable to reset my password, and I am unable to look up my username. I keep getting the same message over and over again saying that ""We are unable to do that at this time."" Thats only been happening since the last update, so something had to have gone wrong and needs to be fixed.",Negative
"This app has the necessary features to be useful, BUT it doesn't retain the info entered by the user. How does that play out as a user experience? Imagine turning your phone's data connection back on after a flight and having to A) look up and enter your Fly Delta app password to open the app for your connecting flight details. Now imagine having to look up and enter your confirmation number to look at those flight details as you're walking across an airport with your carry on belongings in tow",Negative
"You know your app is bad when it almost makes someone want to stop using the airline. Mostly started having trouble once I switched back to Samsung. My note 10 cant load boarding passes half the time, wont let me check in even on wifi more than half the time. It's really a bad app. Great airline but it's so dumb that they wont spend just a little more of their large piles of money on a decent app.",Negative
"This update is horrible. It won't remember trips, requiring a confirmation number every single time the app is reopened. Rather defeats the whole convenience of the app if I have to look up the confirmation number and save the boarding pass to photos as a primary document rather than a back up. If there's a gate change, the app doesn't notify, either.",Negative
"Decent functionality. Bag tracking easier than in the website, for example. BUT: a few days ago I renewed my SkyClub membership online (previously done it at the Club), and thereafter the app started crashing constantly. According to crash logs, obviously a MyWallet-spesific decimal separator problem (dot works, comma crashes), I had to temporarily change the phone language setting to US English to keep the app usable at all until I finish the ongoing and quite complex flight itinerary. Pls fix!",Negative
"A lot like Delta's internal systems, the app has been plagued with issues over the past several months. Save yourself the hassle and get paper copies of your boarding passes. Or make certain you save the electronic qr code as being locked out of your boarding passes once past security is a hassle. I",Negative
Keeps all info for possible fligjrs and uses the info for higher prices! Very disappointed!,Negative
The only way to see upcoming trips and check in is to look up the trip via the reservation number (I literally never have that readily available) or enter my 16 digit credit card number...who thought that was a good idea?! This app is so poorly done it makes me want to go back to flying AA just for the ease of use of their app! (I fly for business every single week!),Negative
"After I check in, my boarding pass disappears and my trip is no longer listed under my trips. I have to keep looking it up with the confirmation number. Not convenient. I also can't see if my Known Traveler Number on my boarding pass. I just had TSA send me to the back of the security line because I didn't have pre check in my boarding pass. It was there on my out bound trip.",Negative
"Poorly designed. I signed up and try to log in. It does not recognize my password. When I request to reset password, it takes me to the website, which is also very poorly designed. Also, links in app, when I enter as guest, take me to 404 pages, cannot find page. 12-16-19 Update: Continues to malfunction. It didn't work over the weekend. Now, it won't let me log in.",Negative
"It is easy to use, but several parts of the app simply don't work. Updating my address, for example... Is does not accept my address, no matter what I do, even though it is correct. Pre-purchasing wifi also doesn't work (they want you to spend extra $8 purchasing during flight, which it suspiciously works...)",Negative
"This app could be great except it doesn't store boarding passes on the device and I can't count the number of times I've checked into my flight and at the airport been unable to retrieve my boarding pass without rebooting my phone. In addition, the flight I'm about to get on often mysteriously disappears from my trips the day of travel. Overall I use it because it allows for convenient check-in, but it's otherwise been a disaster for 5 years since I first installed it.",Negative
"Disgustingly Horrible, every time there is an update! Here I am in the middle of another trip, get a ""test"" message from Delta, and now can't get logged in to the app at all. When it works, it is nice, but the developers are very consistent in breaking it at the worst possible times. Absolutely HORRIBLE quality control before they push it out. SO frustrating!!",Negative
"Will uninstall this worthless app once again. I keep hoping and trying this, but it is way behind the screens at the airport",Negative
"never works, what's the point. I'm a sky miles member woohoo, I dont feel special at all. ***EDIT*** Now I'm a Silver Medallion, who cares, somehow the app got worse, I can't book flights from it, can't do squat on this app",Negative
Finished on first page can't even register.,Negative
Boarding passes are great in this app,Positive
"Latest update wouldn't open, uninstalled and reinstalled. OK now. LG V35",Positive
Same story as many others. Works great when it works. Forgets all your trips every day or two,Negative
i wish there was a button when youre on your way but about to miss your flight lol . makes you go to website to get # but overall great,Positive
Great app from booking the flight to getting back home.,Positive
Won't show my ticket. It just says it's too close to my departure time to check in. I'm already checked in. I'm at the gate. Just show me the **** ticket!,Negative
"Boarding passes disappear randomly. Seriously, you had one job...",Negative
Useless PoC. You can immediately tell it never went through user testing. Blocking an account for trying to log in is the most stupid thing I've seen. And making the user CALL?? An airline??? I'd rather NOT fly Delta.,Negative
App works fine except for sky club. When I select an airport the app closes. Galaxy S9,Negative
"It never remembers my flights, and requires me to repeatedly enter my confirmation number to view my boarding pass.",Negative
"Horrible experience!! Errors while booking international trip of 4 people, Credit card being charged $4.5K × 3, one for each error, no confirmation email and most importantly, NO ONE CONTACTED ME TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AFTER EMAILING CUSTOMER SERVICE COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT!!!!",Negative
My ticket disappeared and my confirmation no. Wouldn't work AFTER I already checked in.,Negative
Unable to view boarding passes for my flights MNL > NRT > ATL > MSY. and also unable to message via app.,Negative
Could use some improvements but probably the best airline app of the US airlines. Delta doesnt seem to take feedback.,Positive
"Don't log in as guest, as it may forget your boarding pass.",Negative
"Terrible at finding the flights, use the same information online at get instant results.",Negative
Glitchy. Forces you to enter confirmation number repeatedly instead of just remembering your trip.,Negative
So the app crashed while I was trying to cancel a flight that's been PENDING REFUND on their website ALL DAY before it leaves tomorrow and when I relaunched the app it had checked me in!!!! 45 minute wait for a rep and he confirmed the static was HIS END and he'd call me back 50 mins ago! Tried calling back on another line and the wait is 58 more minutes!!! DON'T FLY DELTA!!! IT'S A NIGHTMARE AND I MAY BE OUT NEARLY A THOUSAND BUCKS ON THIS INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT I'M NOT TAKING TO KOREA NOW!!! ??,Negative
The app continues to get better! When will you add the ability to save my BP to Google Pay? Why do you only support this kind of feature for iOS?,Positive
App itself works great but visually needs to add nav bar color and add Google pay boarding passes.,Negative
App couldn't even open for some months now. Scrap it and introduce a better App. Its a disgrace to Delta's HIGH STANDARD in the Airline business.,Negative
"Hangs and crashes all the time, unreliable app from otherwise reliable air carrier.",Negative
Doesn't work half of the time . I have to put all my info in each time I use it and then it forgets it then I got to do it again,Negative
Great to track my baggage and up to date standby list,Positive
The app of the year for technical difficulties. An almost useless app. Most disappointing.,Negative
Why doesn't it save boarding passes to Google Pay? Also why does it exit the app when I press the back button? So irritating.,Negative
Constantly crashes. It won't even open,Negative
The app logs me off and denies login at the most inconvenient situations. Delta CIO and IT team leaders need a good a$$ kicking to motivate flawless service.,Negative
"Horrible. All it ever says is, The App is having technical difficulty. Useless app and you certainly can't rely on it for your boarding pass.",Negative
This app has so many nice touches. My favourite example: weather in your destination is shown in Farenheit. Tap the number and it changes to Celsius. Delightful!,Positive
"I am a Sky Miles member. I am using this app for the first time. I am traveling tomorrow. I am checked in and feel great! Using the app takes away stress of travel. I also fly needs assistance, so I can be sure there will be travel assistance at every leg of my flights! Thank you, Delta! You are the best!!!",Positive
"Worst check in process I've ever had. Every few seconds the app would stop, load something, then take me back to the starting page. The app charged me for a checked bag (got credit card notification), then said ""sorry, we could not process your order."" I had to fill in my information multiple times. It took nearly 20 minutes instead of the usual 20 seconds. Nothing loads. Half the features are broken. Tried checking in through an iPhone, that was just as bad. - I don't plan on flying Delta.",Negative
"Constantly forgets my trip that I am on despite me entering the confirmation number many many times. When I need a boarding pass and it suddenly forgets that I'm going to be flying today, that's not very helpful. By the end I had memorized my number because I had to enter it so many times. Overall slow and clunky. Love flying delta but sheeeeesh.",Negative
"Does not recognize my login/ password etc. I had restarted my password just for the sake of it although I didn't need to. I tried again, and still says credential not recognize. Just terrible.. I was this close to purchase a flight with delta. Given this hassel I don't see my self using this app nor delta in general. Fix this up Delta, I had seen you as high standard and was thinkingb of become loyal customer. But ever time having an issue logging in is not convenient",Negative
"The app is okay and does its duty... **Navigation within app** Compared to the iPhone version, I think the navigation without buttons on the bottom for easy access of My Delta/Today/etc is a bit annoying (you first need to click the burger menu, then select...) - so usability-wise, I much prefer this feature on the iPhone version. **Accessing the boarding passes** Also, please integrate a pkpass export into Google Pay (like you do for Apple Passbook), or implement at least an Android notification (starting 3 hours before the flight) that brings you directly to the Today view - which would make it much easier to quickly access the boarding pass. Looking forward to future updates - and keep climbing!",Positive
"Would be great if it works. This app has the uncanny ability to lose my reservation in the app almost every time I'm standing at the gate waiting to check in, or at passport control when I need to scan in. Suggest screenshotting your QR code boarding pass so you don't lose it at crucial moments.",Negative
The book function from the app does not work. I cannot change the destination.,Negative
"Won't even allow me to set up my account. Guess through the whole process, to then give me an error message at the very last step. I do get an email welcoming me, but when trying to log in it tells me I don't have an account. Tried setting up my account again, same issue.",Negative
I think they intentionally made it difficult to use. It forget your trip. give you a panic heart attack when you trying show your boarding pass at gate. it tell you to log in. It should not need rocket science to fix those bugs. Very annoying.,Negative
"Easy to navigate, and fast.",Positive
"Easy user interface, accurate and timely updates while in flight and at the airports. Check-in is very easy, and I screenshot the QR code temporarily in case I have connection issues when approaching security. If in flight entertainment with Delta Studio was more integrated with the app that would be nice. Downloading another app and waiting for the links to load in a separate window when selecting movies is inconvenient.",Positive
"Constantly will not show seat assignments and will give a ""oops something went wrong and to try back later"". Gold members are to be able to access to seat selection 72hrs in advance but it doesn't seem to allow that anymore, just gives error codes.",Negative
At the check mark for check-in there is larger font reads 14 hours to check-in. Lower down in smaller font it reads 1D 14 hours check-in. Make both places read the remaining time before check-in. In other time zones that could be confusing. No flight in to Philippines but app did advise me not to go to the airport. App was useless in that regard. App needs much work.,Negative
Why such important information as boarding pass is not stored locally and readily accessible? Why half of the time after I background the app I have to search for my flight again entering the confirmation number? The app has some nice features like airport map but surprisingly lack a simple convenient functionality.,Negative
"This app is GARBAGE! Do NOT use this app to check in for international flights or it will screw you and you'll have to arrive at the airport an additional 2 hours early for your flight. Or better yet, just book the flight with American, United, or any other airline that has an app that works correctly.",Negative
"Thanks for making the TSE checkmark so small on the new app interface that even with bifocals you can't see it and for making it bright red instead of blue so that you think something's wrong when you open your app. Nice changes, why don't you consider people who actually fly and use the app and make the TSA Pre sign visible to someone who just glances at their phone without their glasses on even with bifocals it's too small to see.",Negative
"If a companion is traveling in the same flight with a separate ticket, please provide the ability to tie their PNR(confirmation number) on the app so if we select seats adjacent to each other, we do not lose that because of upgrades for one of the passengers.",Positive
"Update: latest version still has the same bug. Pretty good app, except that when traveling with multiple passengers, it presented the wrong barcode to security. Finally tried the other barcode with their name and came up as mine on TSAs scanner, but that's a pretty serious flaw in the app!",Negative
"While the Delta App is what it is (a airline application) I haven't used it in quite some time. Today, it popped up with a notification on my phone with the title and text of ""test"". Sounds like a compromised application; no thank you. Uninstalling.",Negative
"Used to love the app. Clean UI. Gives me quick control of critical features. But then with a build this year, it gets hung loading constantly. Only resolves with closing and reopening the app then waiting. It's the one thing ruining the app.",Negative
"SUPER clunky app. Poor design. When trying to create a SkyMiles profile, I filled out all the fields before it told me my password was invalid. I had to fill the whole thing out 5 or 6 times because it kept copying info I'd filled out into the wrong fields and causing different errors.",Negative
"Get error messages when I try to reset my password. Only option is to call customer service. Locked out of account. Call customer service. ""Please say or enter your long-ass delta account number."" Pass.",Negative
Nice idea and mostly works well. Functions are too limited vs website and experience way too many errors when trying to book or purchased upgrades to seats. Don't offer a seat upgrade and then tell me you can't process it. Please fix these issues.,Negative
Very limited functionality. It also never seems to remember you username when you ck the box. It also seems to take 4 times for the password to work. It always says you have entered the wrong pw. Very poor app.,Negative
Ahh!! It's twice now that the app decides to forget my flight and boarding pass while in line. How have they not fixed the need for internet access yet? Take screenshots of your boarding passes if you use this app.,Negative
"Locked me out of my medallian account by repeatedly trying to connect with wrong password after I changed password via web site. Then told me to call customer service to unlock account, but customer service says I have to wait 24 hours after last logon attempt. Lots of bugs when it did connect.",Negative
"Often can't find your flight or say it is ""unable to find your reservation with infomation I provided"" even though the info provided is correct. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it is very frustrating.",Negative
"This app sucks compared to literally all other airline apps. Look at Alaska or United to see what a good one looks like. Delta inexplicably just seems to open your browser to their site, and is not at all tuned to mobile devices.",Negative
"This used to be one of my favorite airline app (and still is from a functionality standpoint) but ARE YOU KIDDING with the new design and color scheme? It hurts the eyes, is not consistent, light blue, dark blue, hot pink, white - what is going on??? I think there have been more than enough negative reviews complaining about the revised design - you should seriously consider reverting back.",Negative
"It's a nice app and worked for my flights... When it actually worked. There's a constant issue with it forgetting your ""trip"" so you have to enter your confirmation code over and over again (usually at the most inconvenient time). Or the app will refresh while you're using it and forget the very trip you're looking at, so you have to put your code in again. Super annoying.",Negative
"Just got a notification that only said ""test"". Now I think it's only a matter of time before I start getting notifications for ads. So the test mostly just reminded to uninstall the app.",Negative
"Buggy. Added my flights to the app, which seemed to save them. When I tried to check in, the app lost my flights. It lost them again when I tried to board. I pretty much need to type in my confirmation number each time. Also: really poor experience purchasing Wi-Fi. I bought Wi-Fi while booking a flight, and I was charged for it. The app has no record of that and even gives me the option to buy Wi-Fi for the same flight. No mention of Wi-Fi in any emails either. When I called Delta, they told me I had to call a different company.",Negative
"The app now logs me out every time I come back into it on my phone if it was already open. Having to log in every time I want to check my gate is insane. Basically use the app to open your boarding pass, then screenshot the pass, because when you try to pull up your pass at the gate, it'll log you out then have to reload the pass. If you don't want to hold up the line behind you just screenshot or print your boarding passes, cause this app is a buggy mess.",Negative
This is the worst app I've had. I cannot log into my account with it. There seems to be nice features - if I could ever use them. I can log on with my computer and through the browser on my phone - just not through the app.,Negative
"2019 Oct: I simply don't get it. Let's take this use case: I am in comfort, and 2nd on the upgrade list for 1st class. I see that there are 3 available in 1st class. I click on the seat map but it shows no available seats. However, if I go to Book, select the same date and flight, I can see the seats. WHY? Why work so hard for this info?",Negative
Love Delta (relatively to other airlines) but the app leaves a lot to be desired like actually working. Check in doesn't work half the time. ?? When you land it displays a message about where your bag is going that disappears when you try to read it. Why do I have to put in my confirmation# etc. to pull up info. Isn't not having that info whole point of using when that's the point of having the app!? Boo!,Negative
"Good when it works. Often times doesn't work. The last two days, all I can get is a notice that the app is having technical difficulties. I'm a very frequent customer of Delta and find them to be a good airline BUT a major housecleaning of the I.T. department has long been needed...for years now. C'mon Delta, hire some good professionals for the job.",Negative
Add Google Pay and face unlock functionality,Negative
"There is no option to save your boarding pass to your phone. This is important since the app randomly loses boarding passes. I was unable find the boarding pass for the flight I was boarding; the today section didn't think I had any flights, even though I had used it less than half an hour prior to go through security. I had to get out of line and punch in all my flight info, including card number, to find it. Print a paper pass as a backup.",Negative
"App ""dropped"" my boarding pass; had to be replaced with paper. I had my boarding pass in this app, and it worked without issue while I went through security. However, by the time I got to the gate, the app logged me out, and then when I re-entered my login information, it wouldn't show me my boarding pass anymore! The gate agents were willing to print me a new one -- but I had to wait in line, and it would have been faster and less stressful to just start off with a paper boarding pass.",Negative
"App is fine when it works, but in both my samsung s9 and s10+ every so often all my trips disappear. I have to retype them in one by one. Imagine how nice it is when you are boarding and your boarding pass is not there anymore... and you have to ask to print your boarding pass. From business class, you end up boarding as the last person on the flight. Plus check-in process most of the time does not get the information from the profile, forcing you to input name passport all of it ... unreliable.",Negative
"Figured by now you should be able to pull up your boarding pass anytime. Never fails, I have my boarding pass open and ready to scan, only to have my screen shut off and to turn it back on as I'm approaching the boarding doors or tsa, only to see a blank screen... This has been happening for years. I now take a screenshot because the app sucks so bad!",Negative
"Fall from Grace... The good: it's a nice looking app, colors and all. The bad: it will leave you at the gate without a way to board. Was in line, ticket showing on screen. Then boom, app refreshed, now all of my flight and everything is gone. Requires that I log in, and after, still no tickets. I'd expect more from a startup, as an experienced app developer, consumers deserve more.",Negative
"If you are flying Delta, download this app for-sure! It was incredibly helpful. Just show your boarding pass right on the phone. Gives updates on your flight status, and if your flight has a major delay, quickly gives you other flights that you can switch to with the touch of a button to get you to your destination as soon as possible. You can even track your checked luggage. I'll never fly without it. Thank you for making such a useful app!",Positive
"This app is very reliable - in the sense that anytime you know you really need it, anytime you're at the airport, you'll receive a ""technical difficulties"" error message.",Negative
The app is constantly resetting even while my boarding pass is displayed. To have the app reset and make me search for my itinerary again and again while in line for security and for boarding is a huge fail for an airline app.,Negative
"Probably one of the best airline apps available. It can be used to book, manage, upgrade flights. Good info on flight departure and arrival, including weather. Plus the feature to track your bag. ",Negative
"I have to take another star away from this app, as the latest versions now feature ""obnoxious white background"" mode. Whether you're on an overnight red-eye, a passenger in a dark car at night, or in a darkened conference room at work, prepare for the pain of being blinded while having everyone nearby glare at you with scorn as you open the Fly Delta app. This app needs a dark theme or night mode as a settings option really badly! Ugh!",Negative
"When I initially installed the app I would have given it 4 stars. But now every time I attempt to choose a flight to book I always get an error message saying ""Oops! We're sorry...no flight search results matching the criteria could be found. Even deleted and reinstalled the app. Continue to get the same message. I use a Samsung S10.",Negative
"Terrible experience!!!!! All the information I had to reenter since I did that months ago! Time consuming and for that matter nerv wrecking! What is the purpose of an app if it does ask for the exact same information I have already entered? Gladly, I was at home so I could gather all the information I have already entered. Just to be sure, I did screenshots of the boarding passes since I have learned that a few passengers ran into issues with boarding passes not appearing. Delta, you can definitely do better > I am rooting for you guys!",Negative
"Kept losing my travel info. Seriously, how many times do I have to put it in? This app needs work. It lost my ticket info as I was boarding the plane. Didn't have my phone in airplane mode either. Try again.",Negative
