"Works well most of the time. Would be better with an option to read your password when typing it in, as on the website version. Would also be better to automatically save the boarding passes to the phone such that it is not necessary to login and have web access to find it again",Positive
"Really cool app. Used it for my trip to and from hawaii. Has maps of the airports, automatic tracking of your bags, gate updates, and departure times. Only hitch I had was it kept losing my flight and I haf to re-enter confirmation info over 10 different times which can get tedius/annoying when you",Positive
"The app was great but the update often shows no flights at crucial times such as when making a connection. Also my husband and I have 2 different sky miles accounts yet his flights and boarding passes show in his and mine, on 2 separate phones. Something is wrong.",Positive
"Often flight info just disappears forcing to use ""Find My Trip"" again. Unable to view seat availability when flight is operated by a partner airlines.",Positive
Not bad does well with standard flights but once flights are delayed the info is unreliable and the system handles these changes very poorly. The only reason i can't give this app a 5 star.,Positive
The app continues to get better! When will you add the ability to save my BP to Google Pay? Why do you only support this kind of feature for iOS?,Positive

Could use some improvements but probably the best airline app of the US airlines. Delta doesnt seem to take feedback.,Positive
"Latest update wouldn't open, uninstalled and reinstalled. OK now. LG V35",Positive
"The app is okay and does its duty... **Navigation within app** Compared to the iPhone version, I think the navigation without buttons on the bottom for easy access of My Delta/Today/etc is a bit annoying (you first need to click the burger menu, then select...) - so usability-wise, I much prefer thi",Positive
"Easy user interface, accurate and timely updates while in flight and at the airports. Check-in is very easy, and I screenshot the QR code temporarily in case I have connection issues when approaching security. If in flight entertainment with Delta Studio was more integrated with the app that would b",Positive
"If a companion is traveling in the same flight with a separate ticket, please provide the ability to tie their PNR(confirmation number) on the app so if we select seats adjacent to each other, we do not lose that because of upgrades for one of the passengers.",Positive
"I generally like this app much more than other airlines, but for over three years I have been seeing ""Sorry, a fatal error has occurred..."" when clicking View Seats/Seats. At a MINIMUM, from a basic user experience standpoint, remove the word ""fatal."" I work in mobile app dev, this is Marketing 101,",Positive
"Great for expediting my travel experience. My only complaint is when it asks for an option to upgrade seats, my second flight after a connection does not show me on both the first class and the comfort plus upgrade lost. The app seems to just choose one at random. Not a huge deal, I know, but a glit",Positive
Won't let me print a paper bdg pass any more Like it as a backup if phone freezes or dies unexpectedly,Positive
"Pretty accurate app, I'm pleased for now.",Positive
Pilots amazing what they do!!! My first time flying loved flight to cities very fast. Now from cities to cancun was a little scary about last hour or 2 due to turbulance. Well if people would just stay seated probably not so bad. Hated waiting to get to ur seat n get off the plane! Worst part. Oh an,Positive
"This last trip had a delay due to weather. The app told me that it was running late and suggested that I get a different connecting flight. It was so helpful and that new flight was at no charge (maybe because I had the insurance?) The reason for the 4 stars is that, while it was usually great at re",Positive
"It works almost entirely as it should, but one of the programmers needs to fix the text entries for departure and boarding times. On every single one of my flights it will say something ridiculous like ""departs at 10AM, boards at 1230PM. It's an easy fix and I don't see why it wouldn't be patched.",Positive
"Missing one important thing. Users should be able to complain/compliment their flight crew through a form in the app. Click on the flight, click leave feedback about your experience, and allow user to type. i had a great crew bwi->slc, but forgot their names by the time i got internet access.",Positive
"I love the app but, it does not let you check in for your flight. Also, there is a glitch where when you minimize the app, any info that was input disappears. Sometimes multi-city flights will disappear after, making one flight. Please fix these issues.",Positive
Overall a pretty decent app. Only issue is lately I'm getting my baggage loading and unloading notifications about a week after the fact. Just got one late last night saying my bag is now on the carousel. I've been home for 6 days.,Positive
Once I'm logged in I should not need to enter my name and confirmation number every time I want to see my upcoming flights. They should just be available for me to click on.,Positive
Should be able to use your regional upgrades and other certificates on the app.,Positive
Not allowing me to check in thru the app,Positive
Overall great app. would give it 5 stars if I had the ability download a copy of my boarding pass. Keep up the great work Delta!,Positive
sometimes a little wonky when boarding pass updates and with checked luggage. otherwise not bad. can even book flights in flight if connected to wifi.,Positive
gave me all of my flight information and kept it updated for me so i could find my gates. I recommend this to anyone including first time flyers because for my first time flying they helped me make it easier.,Positive
"no pre-tsa identification on boarding pass is a pain because i have to stop for a printout before security. othewise, great app.",Positive
I experienced great service while on flight....but I experienced a lot of turbulence on my connecting flight ....nearly made me sick. but all and all it went well.,Positive
"easy to look up flight and seat availability. but, I don't think it accounts for the oversold flights and shows available seats when in fact not the case.",Positive
"I have the same general issues that most people have had. It loses trips just about every time I travel. When I try to reenter my info it can't find the trip at all. It also carries over to the website so luckily I screen shot my boarding passes as soon as i get them. Awesome idea, terrible executio",Negative
Logged me out multiple times while at the airport. Had a problem where my flight arrived late and it wouldn't show my originally scheduled connecting flight. It only showed a new flight that I could switch to. Had to look up the flight and gate info manually. Gate staff assured me that I still had a,Negative
The app used to work very well. Recently (since Jan 2020) it is prone to glitches and ghost notifications. Check in gets stuck and abandon the app to check in on website. If first leg of flight requires checking in on partner airline (KLM) the app won't get past the check in and is worthless for the,Negative
"The app works for booking and getting flight information but it has some serious shortcomings: to do anything it wants confirmation number every time you do flight anything. The confirmation number is not displayed on the online boarding pass, so you have to dig through emails to find it. Then the a",Negative
"Poor for real needs. You think this apps main purpose is to tell you what your travel plans are and show you your ticket that you just checked in with (and check in before arrival to airport, but that's a failure too) but the app fails more than half the time. It's more frustrating to use. Just expe",Negative
"Sheesh this app is frustrating. I use this app BECAUSE I'M FLYING, focus on THAT. As others have said it frequently loses your trips requiring you to reenter you confirmation number/credit card/ticket number. It throws errors constantly. Highly unreliable. Frankly, if you can't get it right for thos",Negative
"Nice when it works. But just doesn't load my boarding pass for same day flights majority of my travels. I have to go through their website and manually type in my confirmation to have it text to me. Might be an issue with Android specifically I'm not sure. Has happened with all my devices, so I know",Negative
"So the app deleted my flight info after I got into the TSA with it and I had to scramble through multiple of their emails to find the confirmation code, which was link which opened the app but also still couldn't find my flight ... had to *manually* type it in...no prob but unnecessarily complicated",Negative
"Decent app when it works. The check in function has not worked for my last three flights. This is incredibly inconvenient. When I am able to check in, the app has a tendency to crash right as I need to scan my ticket. Helpful tip- screen shot your ticket if you are lucky enough to be able to access",Negative
"Good app....when it works! I have already checked in for a flight early tomorrow morning, but now the app tells me I ""have no upcoming flights"" and "" find my flight"" can't find my flight. Not the first time this has happened. Restarted the app numerous times over the last 2 hours..still not working.",Negative
"In fairness, I still can't judge accurately, but I'll try again to see if the app still restarts after I manually Force Stop or hibernate it from a utility app, adding to the drain on the battery. Might uninstall & reinstall when needed. To Moto G5+ users w/Oreo 8 & 8.1 who reported this app useless",Negative
"This app sucks, not only does it lack basic features that the other major airlines have (such as making same day flight changes), but it is also pretty confusing to use. I am in my twenties so naturally I am pretty good with technology and apps, but this one manages to confuse me at times.",Negative
"Keeps saying I hit my limit on password entries even right after I update my password, so it's an endless cycle. I have better luck going directly to the site via a browser.",Negative
"Why does the app have to crash every time someone asks to see my boarding pass? Even the Delta staff joke that you are better off taking a screenshot than relying on the app... Other than that, the app is really great! ..have you guys tried testing the app before releasing?",Negative
"When it works it's fine, but frequently loses track of upcoming trips. Frustrating when you're about to board and suddenly no longer have a boarding pass.",Negative
"It has all the functions it should, but it is consistently forgetting my trips. I'll be in the middle of a trip looking for my connecting flight info and be forced to re enter my information multiple times per trip. Extremely annoying.",Negative
Slow to update and receive data. I lose my boarding pass to often and have to wait after it kicks me out.,Negative
"My boarding pass vanished from the app multiple times within an hour, leaving me to scramble as I boarded, what exactly is the point of this app?",Negative
"When it works, it's fine. Keep getting locked out and account froze. App drops intermittently usually at boarding when I'm trying to display my boarding pass.",Negative
Great when it works. When you change your password you are automatically locked out of the app for 24 hours.,Negative
The app of the year for technical difficulties. An almost useless app. Most disappointing.,Negative
"Tracking map will not work when looking at flight status... when clicked, it says app is not working and exits out of the entire app.",Negative
Glitchy. Forces you to enter confirmation number repeatedly instead of just remembering your trip.,Negative
"It never remembers my flights, and requires me to repeatedly enter my confirmation number to view my boarding pass.",Negative
