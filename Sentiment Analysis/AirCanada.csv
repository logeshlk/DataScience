Review,Sentiment
"Horrible. I tracked a flight from last Saturday, and because they use the same flight number regularly, I am now getting notices about this week's flight. No way to delete it, or another flight number that I entered incorrectly. Had to uninstall and reinstall (because that's the only way you can track their flights). Total garbage.",Negative
I used this app and worked great and would have given it a 5 star until I upgraded it recently. Lost all my flight information and reservations and cannot retrieve this important information for my return home. I deleted the app and reinstalled it with no success. This leaves me stuck as can't use telephone for air Canada and they have no email to confirm flight information. This is very upsetting to say the least. Richard,Negative
"6 month ago I gave a 1 to AC app, it was a mess.... Now it's getting better and better and I use it daily without any problem. Still slow and the waiting should be manage better. Next step the visual which is minimal. Keep it up",Negative
This is the worst app I've ever used. It won't let me add boarding passes for an existing reservation and checked in for. It would not let me finish the check in process and I had to use the website on a laptop instead. What's the point of offering the app if it's useless?,Negative
"This app sucks so bad that you should consider using west jet. Every second booking the check in is not working, not on the cell phone or i pad. I will consider not flying air canada anymore because of there failing app. Convinence out the window back to old style check in.",Negative
Honestly if I can give this app a zero I would. Nothing but frustration with Air Canada and Aeroplan credentials. I travel often with many airlines and this app has to be the worst. The user interface absolutely useless. So frustrating.,Negative
Worked well until november changeover in software - never works now - need name and booking reference number to do anything - why cant they use flight number or aeroplan number as well - who carries their booking refernce number? Useless app now.,Negative
"This app NEVER works. All you get is ""sorry an error has occurred. We hope to resolve this issue soon. You can't download your boarding pass or check your flight status",Negative
"Tapping ""continue"" button twice causes failure. I was unable to check-in using app. After I checked-in at air Canada web page I cannot add boarding passes to the app.",Negative
Booking references not found? I can check my booking just fine on air Canada website so this app is not working. Update 27.2.2020 - it's working again. Hopefully it still works after future updates.,Positive
You went from being a useable app which allowed you to basically check everything about your flight to basically a bloated app that points to your website. Worst is you are forced to update the app!,Negative
Doesn't work. Keeps giving me an error message every time I look up my flight. I have installed and re-installed several times to no avail.,Negative
What a garbage app. Doesn't update any information (Gate.. seat ) and it keeps giving me an error when adding the boarding pass. Such an embarrassment.,Negative
"The flow is completely wrong and unintuitive. Check-in and boarding passes under ""More"", Really? Notifications now limited to one option. All or nothing choice. And calendar integration, disapeared? Or just just hidden many layers down in a menu item. UPDATED to 3 starts from 1 because of improvements described below. Calendar synch is half there hidden a few layers down but has to be trigged manually for each trips. Still not intuitive.",Negative
"Like the other reviewers, the app is very difficult as every step taken results in a message informing me that the session is no longer available. Check-in online is easier but another barrier is the app is not compatible on any Samsung device (not available for download to our Samsung tablets from Google Play). This is not good if you have kids!!!!",Negative
"The flow is completely wrong and unintuitive. Check-in and boarding passes under ""More"", Really? Notifications now limited to one option. All or nothing choice. And calendar integration, disapeared? Or just just hidden many layers down in a menu item. UPDATED to 3 starts from 1 because of improvements described below. Calendar synch is half there hidden a few layers down but has to be trigged manually for each trips. Still not intuitive.",Negative
"Your app is as bad as your customer service. Absolutely garbage. Will not get another dollar from me after throwing up error codes, and TRIPLE CHARGING ME for a single ticket. And not even giving it to me. Then sitting on hold for 3 HOURS, WHILE OFFERING ""GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE"" figure it out",Negative
"Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Old App gave you so much more! Used the App in December to do an e-upgrade for my self and a companion, received a confirmation, then when arrived at airport there was no upgrade applied. The ticket counter couldn't fix it as they can no longer upgrade seats to Business Class, so ended up in some lousy seats in Economy. But here's the kicker, they took the upgrade credits anyway and 6 weeks later still have not given them back!",Negative
Absolutely horrible app. Basic functions such as Upgrades and Check in to flights does not work. I (50K Gold) tried to upgrade tickets on our honeymoon flight and app would not work. Direct aerplan member reservations hotline and staff at YYZ completely unfriendly and unwilling to help. Travel a lot for work and have always had good experiences. However when it came to the honeymoon flights and AC change to the new system it's been a complete failure. Do not use this app for any AC service.,Negative
"Updated Jan 25. Still buggy, and no seat preview and NO CALENDAR SYNC. PLEASE PUT BACK THE CALENDAR SYNC. Awful. Two weeks later and still absolutely awful. I cannot put my flight pass bookings on this even manually! I cannot get my boarding pass for my flight today. That is the one thing that this app is supposed to let you do. Plus you cannot see seats anymore you can't sync with your calendar, I can go on forever. What an absolutely useless piece of junk.",Negative
"Thanks for not improving the app. Bug fixes dont count. Now it crashes too! Come on AC - why no response about the app? STILL NO CALENDAR INTEGRATION!!! New interface is awful, no info summary or main page check in or boarding pass. I thought the United app from 3 years ago was bad. Shame on you for changing. There was no need. Can I give this ZERO stars?",Negative
"New app is awful. Missing a lot of functionality that was previously included. I can't even see what seats I've booked for a reservation. This is basic information that should be in any airlines app. Between this and the debacle with the new reservation system Air Canada has really dropped the ball. Update: Now the app is missing trips and is constantly showing errors when trying to add them. Again, this is basic stuff an airline app should be able to do.",Negative
"Update : Now that the tech issues have been addressed, changing to 4 stars from 1 star earlier. The checkin functionality is great and also like to call out ability to view incoming flights, often 3-4 flights down. Need to have Altitude Status and progression integrated into the app.",Positive
"This is the message I've gotten all day each time I try to use the app typical Air Canada all excuses no action. "" Our apologies, we have encountered a system error and unfortunately we are unable to complete your check-in at this time"" You may also attempt to check in on our website, at an airport kiosk or at a Check-in Assistance counter. Doesn't work on the website either so much for getting a decent seat",Negative
There are features of this app which I appreciate such as tracking the inbound flight. But compared to the previous version much needs to be done to make this useful. As of now you can't get or update your seats. I frequently get messages that my booking has been changed but there's nothing to tell me what's been changed. I even got a message that a flight was cancelled only to have it reinstated 5 minutes later after I had contacted reservations to put myself on another flight. Etc.,Negative
"Worse than the previous version. Harder to navigate. Doesn't show purchase details like Bistro vouchers like the old app did. I would have expected a better overall experience given it was a complete rewrite of the app... What is worse is the sheer number of other AC clients all saying the same thing, the previous app was pretty good, this one is horrid. Can't book flights, or find basic info. Old flights keep showing up. Someone should be fired and yet I doubt AC is reading these reviews.",Negative
"Complete junk. Can't even find my bookings. Useless. Shameful. Unacceptable. Bad. Update: a month after its inception it is still not working. I have two international bookings with AC, both of which changed booking numbers in AC's new reservation system. This dumb app can't find either one, under the old or new booking number. It is incredibly thoughtless of Air Canada to not have resolved this yet. One month later still, my bookings appeared for a while but then disappeared again.",Negative
"Sadly this app is close to useless. Air Canada used to provide information such as what gate your flight is at, but now nothing that is not on your original ticket, keeps prompting to check-in for flight, but I have.",Negative
this app is pretty but does not work. very frustrating when trying to use it for its intended purpose and it just does not work.,Negative
Their User interface is not the best but it works... Most of the time. Just to be safe always print your boarding pass. Also screen capture you boarding pass. They should explain it abit better. The app is tied to your account. Both have to match in order for it to work well. The app works but it is not very intuitive.,Negative
"This is most useless app I have ever tried to use. After I entered my reservation number, it showed the basic information and nothing else. I could not see any details, make corrections or do anything else. This has to go!",Negative
"Constantly issues. Mobile checkin doesnt work, always crashes, in flight demands doesnt load and recommend to change plugin mid-flight which cant happen. No advance seat selection can be made or eupgrades. The only good thing are the email and mobile nofitications",Negative
The app no longer connects to my 1 year old tablet. Worked last year but not now. Looks like air Canada want to charge you $10.00 to rent there iPad if you want entertainment. Just another rip off by air Canada. Sorry for air Canada your not getting g a y more money ey from me. $6000 for a week vacation and you cant even get your app to work right. You should be fired for your poor service e.,Negative
I had access to all my trips as of last Thursday....now all gone....I cant add them back in...I have been in contact with Air Canada on Facebook messanger...I was told to delete the app and download again...I have done that several times....and was also told to go to Air Canada website to check... and that site wont let me sign in....unbelievable....and stressful....I am hoping we are still on the flights we had booked. .... and that I can check in online on Monday....,Negative
"Thso app doesnt work, and wastes timee. I made 5 attempts to check in and app wouldn't do it. I messaged for help and got told to go to a kiosk when I arrive. AC respondent wouldn't recommend trying ant other method for help. So I tried from their website and it worked fine. I am uninstalling this app. A complete waste of time.",Negative
Liked the old version. New one can't find my flights to check in most of the time and when it does usually says it failed check-in but seems to have worked anyways. Need to have standby / upgrade and track inbound all linked to boarding pass instead of having to go through multiple menus each time to look,Negative
Unable to add an existing booking. Logging in doesn't reflect my associated reservations.,Negative
Changing my rating since the problems are fixed in new update. Good work Air Canada.,Positive
"One of the worst aps i have on my phone. I have no idea how to use this and what it can do. A complete moron could design a better product. I want to check in, eupgrade, waitlist and as far as i know this does nothing. I guess all the IT people at AC are dealing with the waaaay bigger issue of booking software. AC should win the award of worst IT team ihe country. Thank God their pilots can fly well cause this team is ""spare parts""!!!",Negative
"Possibly worst app I have used, worse than their last app. Delta's app crushes this one,maybe they should copy it ? App difficult to use, crashes alot and even dumps boarding passes. Lots of oops messages. No surprise from Air Cannot ( sorry spell check). Would give it 0 but 1 is lowest.",Negative
This is by far the worst airline app. Even budget airlines have better app. It takes 30 min to check in and 9 out of 10 time I can't even get a boarding pass in the app. I have to print it out even in the airports with the ability to scan passes.,Negative
"The worst app I've ever used. I should say tried to use. It won't let me enter a trip to Australia, get a message that can not process request when I enter same booking info as online web site. Garbage. Shameful. If a Zero score was available I would have given the app zero. ",Negative
"The new application crashes after 20 second. It must have crashed 10 times. I could not even check in for a flight without it crashing Still having issues month later. Stops half way check-in, invalid boarding pass, random flights added. Not impressed",Negative
"Horrible. Last yr, when we tried to download the app on our 1yr old android tablet it wont work. My even older tablet worked. Then this yr, both tablet cant download. It say it isn't compatible. This is horrible app if only selected devices can download app. NEED TO FIX",Negative
Can't add any upcoming flights to this. Gives an error each time,Negative
"Wow so bad... Even months after it launched! I can't get accurate flight info from the platform. It crashes all the time, too.",Negative
"Bearbone app that doesn't do much. It keeps saying an update is available but when I try to download update, nothing happens. The app itself won't let you do basic stuff like changing your seat.",Negative
"I am now in Dutch Carribean and AC website wouldn't let me check flight status for my outbound flight! As soon as I get to AC website, I get a pop-up blocking the screen that travellers from this country have to contact AC reservation... What about Canadians who are here on vacation and what flight status has to do with reservations? Whoever designed this website is an idiot! The Android app is no better, as soon as I start the app it forces me to upgrade and doesn't let me use existing version.",Negative
"Downloaded this to check in, only to discover it times out on every attempt! Going to check in using an internet browser instead. Keeping this useless app just in case it notifies me of delays or cancellations (doubtful: won't even let me check in)",Negative
Garbage app and airline!! I cant check in with all international cities. Only certain ones. Also our flight # got changed with no notification at all! On top of that no info on our codeshared flight.,Negative
"No matter how many times I try I cannot check in, without Air Canada telling me there's some error. Combine this with the brutal service and canceled flights I'm done. Westjet all the way from now on",Negative
This is a complete and utter joke. It won't find your bookings. It won't let you add them manually-- although it says you can. Most times it won't even let me log on. A disaster. Everyone responsible for this app should be fired,Negative
"Get ""An error occurred that we didn't expected"" when trying to enter my booking details. Phoned Air Canada Customer Services who told me to email their Android support address. Unsurprisingly, I never received a response.",Negative
"Everytime we try to use it there's a problem. Never had a successful check-in. Always get an error, luggage payment went through but it says 0 luggage on the app, etc..",Negative
I can't add my flight booking. I can't access my ticket. I pretty much can't use the app for anything it's MEANT to be used for. I'll change my rating once these are fixed,Negative
"I want the old application! The current one has buggs, and it doesn't show any important information, I only can see those in the the super slow website.",Negative
Terrible app. Won't let me check in 3 flights in a row and locks up all the time. Crappy just like the mismanaged airline. Seeing an average of 1.9 stars was not a shock.,Negative
Booking reference is 7 digits & app only accepts 6? If it's something I'm doing please help. Looks like it might be quite good once I am able to get my reservation registered.,Negative
How to check your past trips? That option is gone. Aeroplan number doesnt apply automatically when you book ticket through app. Aeroplan nmbr gets earsed automatically and ask me to login again,Negative
Pretty good app but I find it ridiculous that it orders boarding passes with the oldest on top. I have to scroll through many old boarding passes to get to the one I need,Negative
This app doesn't work at all. Old app was fantastic this one is waste of time.,Negative
"Painfully bad! Limited reason for using the app as you will be forced on to the website for anything useful. Eup availability works sometimes. It will store boarding pads, other than that nothing. M",Negative
Won't let me add my trip to the app. Error keeps happening.,Negative
Needs more functionality. Also standy and upgrade list works sometimes. No LHR flight departures avail today or tomorrow for instance. Very unreliable compared to old app.,Negative
"Far less functional than previous app. Need to dig through multiple screens to find boarding passes, no way to save boarding pass to Google wallet.",Negative
"Forced app update at the security line, and it didn't retain any login information. Thanks, but no thanks, Air Canada.",Negative
"It was working fine, up until I had to board and the app wouldn't open. Couldn't retrieve my boarding pass. Luckily I took a screenshot just in case.",Negative
"Would think that you can add Star Alliance loyalty program number, not everyone wants Aeroplan points..... Also can't add reservations ... Need to fix this.",Negative
Can't look up upcoming trips on this app. It just returns errors and tells me to try again later,Negative
Very glitchy. Worse than the previous app. Don't depend on it for boarding passes with tight connections.,Negative
App does not show my bookings and will not sync with my account online. The old app used to work perfect. This is not acceptable!,Negative
Each version getting worst. Latest would not even allow to use it on Rouge on a Chromebook. Demands to be on Airplane mode - which cannot be done on a PC without SIM card.,Negative
Don't work. Don't recognise valid booking numbers. This New version don't deliver. Totally useless I'm never sure of my travel plans.,Negative
"Difficult to use, everytime I try and view a flight status it errors out. Nice job messing it up, the old app never this many issues",Negative
"The new updated app is very badly designed. There is no notification to check-in, can't e-upgrade from within the app.",Negative
"Doesn't work anymore Can't add trips, keeps saying it's a problem on their end. Anything I try to do, it crashes.",Negative
Cannot get this stupid thing to work right. It keeps apologizing for errors but doesn't fix them,Negative
P.o.s. app trying to check-in sitting on a beach in cost rica. And the app keeps crashing. Had to borrow someone elses phone and checked-in for my wife and I. Fail. Now I will have to waste vacation time sitting on the phone trying to get it sorted out. Air canada - get your head out of your ass and fix your app. It's been months of nothing but issues for us frequent flyers,Negative
"Terrible app .. slow, poorly designed, makes you want to fly any other airline. Should look at Delta to see how to make a user friendly app.",Negative
"How.... How can this app be this bad.. how do you go from a perfectly good, functional app to this steaming pile of garbage. Features that used to work, no longer work at all or are just missing. Prestige members? Who the f cares about them anymore. Let's take away all the perk features or make them impossible to redeem on the app. WestJet is looking better and better by the day",Negative
The app no longer updates the boarding pass when flights are delayed and your seat changes. Sort of useless now.,Negative
Terrible buggy mess. Can't even add an existing booking or anything.,Negative
an.2nd still buggy. At times it refuses to open. Not user friendly at all.,Negative
pp is awful at the best of times. Flying air Canada is always a headache.,Negative
"Doest work. Get an error when i try to add my fight, so cant even use a digital ticket. Embarrasing as a canadian.",Negative
App worked pretty much as expected. Could have used terminal maps to know where we were going for our next gate.,Positive
Flight has been delayed twice. Gate change once. Not one notification.,Negative
"Won't load my trips, just keeps saying there's been an error and someone has been notified",Negative
"Doesn't show you what terminal you are supposed to go to in the Trips section of the app, you have to go to the boarding pass section and it's annoying af",Negative
Previous app had calendar integration but this version does not which kind of defeats the purpose of having this app.,Negative
Like the new interface however it keeps crashing on my S10+ with Android 10. Only uninstall + reinstall fixes it.,Negative
wow! going backwards fast! What was wrong with the old app?,Negative
I was not able to access my booking and there were several errors.,Negative
Terrible app Keeps crashing. Will not accept flight number.,Negative
"Is it possible to award negative stars? It is the most miserable application (and airline) that ever existed. Never, ever again! Don't care how much more it costs to fly with any other airline.",Negative
Cannot get it to connect in flight on my samsung note 9..,Negative
"Is there any way I can select the seat from the app before check-in? The seat selection feature was there in old app version, but I cant find it in the new app version.",Negative
"Apps still very buggy, can't add existing reservation",Negative
Unable to add flight reservation.,Negative
"Terrible, frustrating, aggravating, and worst of all useless",Negative
Newest update didn't work on my most recent flight (Monday). Disappointing considering that part of my fare pays for this non functioning entertainment,Negative
"I used this for my boarding pass and it crashed just as I tried to scan in at Security. I couldn't get it to restart. I had to leave the long line that I had waited in and go out to get a paper boarding pass then go through the line again. Later I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it working again. Also, it takes a lot of clicks to find the not so obvious location of the boarding passes. The old app was great. This version is not. Samsung Note 10+",Negative
"What have you done? This app used to be so good. You could do so much, so easily. Now I can't manage many of the things I could before. And to make matters worse, old bookings keep popping up no matter how often I remove them. And trips I enter disappear the next day. Its like they took away features, gave it a new face, and called it new.",Negative
"Couldn't book flights to begin with. Finally got through to an agent after several attempts. Then could not check in through the app. No help from agent. We through the website and was able to check in finally. What's the app for then, other than wasting my time. And cost me more money to book my flight because of the delay. Not happy at all",Negative
"How on earth are you supposed to get the app if it's not compatible with your otherwise very useable device? Pity! Everything worked well enough until the upgrade last month. Gotta give Air Canada credit ... I didn't think Rouge could get more difficult and uncomfortable to fly, but sure enough! They managed to make the entertainment inaccessible for all but those lucky enough to have brand new devices.",Negative
"The most destructive update yet. Such a discombobulated app now. Can't refresh flight status for updates, and why 3 different panes to get all the info you should get on one??! No gate info on ""Trips"", have to go to ""Flight Status"", no boarding card in either have to go to ""More"". really?? ""More""??! Because that makes sense and it's intuitive. Actually ""Trips"" literally has no useful information at all. All just awkward and non linear. I can't anticipate where to find the info. Roll it back",Negative
poor customer support. app does nothing but showing your booking.,Negative
Very glitchy. Worse than the previous app. Don't depend on it for boarding passes with tight connections.,Negative
"Totally dislike this app, can't do booking with discount code or do eupgrade or event check in properly. It ended up I had to either use their official website or call the call center which took me a couple of hours just to get things done. I was told that the whole air Canada system changed and it will take times. I hope it won't take too long before I can use the app without difficulty.",Negative
"The Air Canada mobile app did not show the full seat plan. I selected a seat which I was under the impression was a window seat, but actually is a middle seat. Air Canada at the airport cannot help me change the seat as the flight is full. Also they cannot upgrade me to Premium Economy because their new reservation system does not support this, although I was willing to pay. How about actually building systems around serving your customers and ensure that these are user tested before launch?",Negative
"This app is horrid. If it was planned to be horrid, well, AC has outdone themselves! Bravo! I tried to book a flight 2x, and got an error code. So, I book it elsewhere. About an hour later, the app advises me I now have THREE bookings for the same flight! I have THREE confirmation numbers. Which means I have now paid 3x.?? Even though the app said the booking was not made and gave me an error code. I will now work on cloning myself.",Negative
"This app is completely useless. Prior to the redesign it had some flaws, but all around worked ok and easy to use. Booking were automatically loaded if you booked through flight pass, check-in was easy, all boarding passes were displayed and your main screen was a countdown to your next flight. Now there not even a point of taking space up on your phone with this usless app",Negative
"I entered my trips played around all three, but when i return to app they are not there?",Negative
"Completely frustrated. I wanted to sign up for notifications about the flight my dad was on, and your website told me to download your app to do this. However when I use your app there is no where to request updated about a flight. Why?!? I signed up for an account with you, but because it's not flight it won't let me receive notifications. That's not what your website said... Your app has left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth",Negative
No idea what happened but this app is terrible now. The Air Canada app was pretty good before but sometime in the Oct or Nov 2019 time frame I recieved an update that distroyed it. 75 percent of the time it crashes. It is no longer intuitive to use but the worst part is it is impossible to quickly find and book a flight or check into a flight due the the crashing. I would give it negative stars if I could.,Negative
"Edit: 2020-01-11 - new app still terrible. I can login to Aeroplan, but can't login to the new Air Canada using my Aeroplan credentials. It tells me my account is locked out, but Aeroplan is fine. Terrible customer experience, even as a gold member. Thinking of moving to the competition. Awful experience. After discontinuing Mobile+ I can't login to the app. Password reset doesn't work. I can't believe I've been a Gold member for so long with so little support from Air Canada...",Negative
"Buggy, confusing, can't save, freezes, hard to navigate. Just terrible. Trying to get help...phone customer service is nonexistent, and the app often says ""well, this is embarassing..."" this didn't work, we can't tell you why, for how long, and how to fix it. THE WORST.",Negative
"Worst! Basic app basic features. Can't even see your booking it change seats, tickets, etc...seriously AC please look at DELTA airlines app that is the best by far!! Literally I was coming to the gate and the delta app told me I was going to miss my connection and gave me options to choose another flight for FREE in the app before I even got out of the chair!",Negative
"Since the update it has been abysmal. Cannot check in through it, the option just doesnt work. If you can still request upgrade or get on standby I cant find it in the app. The old version was infinitely better. This has now just become an information display only. No functionality",Negative
Very glitchy. Worse than the previous app. Don't depend on it for boarding passes with tight connections.,Negative
"This is the worst app upgrade I've ever experienced. Log in doesn't work, cannot recall boarding passes, user interface is unacceptable, user experience is a big fat zero. Hey Air Canada, why can't you guys get anything right? Why don't you guys start hiring competent people instead giving in to the union.",Negative
"Much worse than previous AC app. Did they do any beta testing before unleashing this on their unsuspecting customers? One example of the many flaws - the Trips screen still show a link to a boarding pass from Dec 11, even though I have taken at least five flights since then. Why not show the most recent boarding pass?",Negative
The old version of the app used to be quite decent but the new update is difficult to use and doesn't work most of the time. Old flight updates stay on the screen and is riddled with errors and technical issues. It's been a few months since the new update and I have not seen any improvements.,Negative
Badly implemented. I can pull up my booking online but not on this app. Makes for a very anxious and dissatisfying experience. Air Canada needs to be more transparent and communicative if they want to keep loyal customers. Better customer service training is for sure required.,Negative
Not happy at all with the new app. I used to easily download my AC flights even when booked with my travel company and it's not working. I go to Air Canada website and I have no issues. Quite annoying as I like having access to my flights in one place.,Negative
Barely passable as an app. Almost no functionality.,Negative
"Horrible app. Barely works, even the rudimentary features. Actually does nothing that even makes it worth installing the app. This is not the future. Merely a glimpse at a very rudimentary past. What is astounding is that someone at the software team at Air Canada has actually approved this app for its customers.",Negative
"Does air canada even remotely care about their customers? I would never fly this garbage airline if there was any other option. You make an app that is completely useless. It is impossible to check in using the app. Trying countless times was completely fruitless. Eventually had to find a computer browser to log in. And trying to phone for support is impossible. Apparently the new system is causing so many problems, they won't even try to take any calls. Garbage app from a garbage company!",Negative
"Highly recommend when you travel with Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge or AC Express.",Negative
"Awful, I tried to uninstall and reinstall, still cannot find flights. I just get an error message saying ""oops, this is embarrassing"" . I'm certain A.C. doesn't care as the government will keeps bailing them out as required, but I guess WJ gets my money again.",Negative
"New app interface is confusing, first page you see is the booking page, not your pass, flight, info etc. All information were in one page (seats, upgrade, standby, boarding pass, now it's all over the place, hard to find the information you need",Negative
Usless This app is now useless and frustrating - was once good. Will not recognize your flight reservation # - just tells you that's embarrassing. Everything about it makes you want to book with a different airline. Have to use the website not this app to get anything done.,Negative
"Not good. Unfortunately, other airline options are limited. The app will not load my upcoming flight. Perhaps it was designed this way to force you to visit check in? The previous app would load my upcoming flights via Aeroplan. Not the case anymore.",Negative
"Rouge in-flight entertainment doesn't work. It boots me from the app into Chrome, which helpfully tells me that I need to be in the app to watch anything. Trying to watch something takes me back to the app and then...nothing happens. Not great.",Negative
Won't show arrival terminal nor seats assigned which is fairly useless.,Negative
Very good. Easy to get around. Thanks Air Canada!,Negative
"Slow, poor format that makes it very hard to navigate. The previous version was much more intuitive and clearly laid out. This one is trying to look pretty but doesn't do a very good job at even that. Air Canada is great but they should consider going back to the old app and making small adjustments to that to fit their new livery and colour scheme.",Negative
"Air Canada still doesn't have the app thing figured out. I can't book tickets with a credit card through the app, always declines it, but I have no problem on the website. When using the electronic boarding pass it doesn't show up in time for connecting flights. And the app just won't even load sometimes. The concept of this app is great, they just need to get it all working properly.",Negative
Looks alright but there is pertinent information that is no longer available. Digital altitude card doesn't seem to be an option anymore and when you click on your flight if it's going through the states used to inform you if you needed to clear customs. I'm currently going to Vancouver then Las Vegas from Calgary. No idea anymore where I'm going to customs.,Negative
I can't even download this app. I've been trying for a week. It kept saying it needed an update. I try to update and nothing happens.... I have no issue downloading or updating any of my other apps. The older version had a better layout and was easier to navigate. I've uninstalled the app and tried to reinstall it. Nothing happening. I fly up to 8 flights a month with Air Canada and this is disruptive to say the least!,Negative
"Terrible app. The version prior to the system change was much better and providing much more information and we were able to request upgrades. This one has minimum info, and now does not work.",Negative
"Basically nothing important works. Cannot check in, fails to retrieve boarding passes, standby/upgrade lists. Only part that really works is retrieving your flight numbers from a booking reference, which is already in your booking email.",Negative
"The app was a complete failure just when I needed it most. Walked up to security to show my boarding pass. The app interface was completely different from yesterday and the boarding passes for my two flights, which I viewed many times yesterday were no where to be found and they could not be retrieved. It looked as if Air Canada had no knowledge of me other than you show me a minimal listing of today's flights. I noted that the app was updated yesterday. I think the update was a complete fail.",Negative
"I really wish the old app was still available! I am using Galaxy S10+ and cannot book a flight through the app, everytime I try to select a city it says no results, try another city? I am traveling between Toronto, Vancouver and LAX, these are major cities that were available in the old app. I wouldn't be upset if first time but this has been ongoing since day 1, and I submitted the error on two previous occasions and included screen shots and still no fix, seriously, taking way too long!",Negative
"There are a few things you'd like expect this app to do well 1) Get to your boarding pass....Nope. most of the time I need to click more, boarding passes, then select the correct one (it shows all old ones). There is no easy notification direct to the boarding pass 2) Show your AC status....nope. Nowhere to be found. This caused me an issue when asking a lounge to print me a new boarding pass. They wouldn't without seeing my status... 3) Check in...nope. Most of the time it's missing",Negative
"Wow, just wow. You took a perfectly good application and really messed it up. The 'new' application is a hybrid mobile app that has very limited features compared to the older application which was just fine. Can no longer change seats, look at the seat map on all flights, etc. This is a giant face-palm ???????. Bring back the older and 'functional' app.",Negative
The app crashes and require reinstall. Could not check in for a flight operated by Omni on the app. Had to go to the browser to check in on the AC website. The old app was more user friendly.,Negative
"The app has taken an enormous step backwards in terms of functionally, design, and performance. Why cannot I edit the features of my flight booked through air canada? Why are boarding passes no longer automatically generated? Why is my name misspelled in the app? On Galaxy S10+ the scrolling animations stutter , menus lag ,and the general aesthetic of the app is visually unappealing. How can this be possible? What exactly was wrong with the previous app? This app feels and runs like its 2009.",Negative
"This app has terrible glitches! The flight tracking information is incorrect and misleading. Not a reliable source of information. When tracking my flight for today, it referred to yesterday's flight - which was cancelled - making it seem like my flight today was cancelled. Came to the airport to find a new flight only to learn that my flight is as scheduled. (Thank goodness). Would not trust the app for accurate flight details.",Negative
"What a horrible update! Trading updated color schemes for greatly decreased functionality makes absolutely no sense. The app is now just a collection of links to websites. Where you used to be able to change seats, bid for upgrades, get your boarding pass, etc these functions now just redirect you to a web browser. Even after the redirect you need to enter your booking number and personal details before using the function. How is this not automatic? Making WestJet look better every day",Negative
"It would not download. I had a previous version of the app, but it required an update in order to use. For some reason the update won't load....so a 6 hour long flight without entertainment. Very annoying. Also it would be helpful if you could let passengers know well before their flight that entertainment is not available. That can't be so difficult eh? Even a pre boarding announcement would help . It was not on my ticket....though I hear that's where you sometimes put in the fine print.",Negative
"Updated app: Have had to re-enter same information more than once. Now app keep closing down, so I can't even read the notifications it's sending me. Previous app was much more usable and stable. Poor job on this version.",Negative
"The updated app as a serious problem with the lay out of the ""add a flight"" page. The space to enter the reference number is at the bottom of the page. When the auto correct on my screen enages it covers refence number and you can't see the space to complete typing the refence number. It seems like a pretty thoughtless design. Could you move the refence space up the pages, which is larley empty space, so the user can read what they typing.",Negative
"What a horrible ""update"". Gone are one click easy checkin based on Aeroplan number and airport of departure, seat previews and selection are nowhere to be found, and you'll now need to carry your status card in a physical wallet as there is no longer an electronic version. Also, it's been quite frustrating having to manually re-add existing bookings - especially given that all suddenly now have new reference numbers. As one of your 100K travelers, AC, I encourage you to rectify this mess ASAP.",Negative
