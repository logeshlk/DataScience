"Myself and 2 girls went to check in and realized one of my daughter's passport had expired (thankful we have Nexus) but custom border was close. Long story short, the check in clerk she (didnt have a name tag and I had forgotten to ask but supervisor's named was Dave) was sooooo accommodating and compassionate towards re-booking (for free) our flights, an extremely limited flight to St. Thomas, I actually was so calm and not even upset with myself that I cant travel until the next day. I was overwhelmed by the level of compassionate and understanding of the staff at Delta airlines. Thank you for making a frustrating human error and turned it into the best circumstances it can be. I am always grateful for you this situation. Thank you Dave and my check in ""angel"" at YVR airport. I am forever grateful of your generosity.",Negative
OMG. I did it so on October 23 this was my very first time flying. Nervous is a understatement. I about crapped my pants. Not to mention i had 4 children under the age of 10 to accompany me. As i boarded the plane it was pretty much smooth even though I did not know what to expect. At take off my 5 year old daughter screamed her lungs off i'm sure scaring other passengers. As a mom I had to stay calm even though my heart was in my stomach. In the air i was a nervous wreck but it's not like I could get off. The turbulence omg omg omg it was consistent even freaked me out more.,Negative
Once the flight attendant Kara and Jay found out it was my first flight they treated me so very well. They continued to check on me and my children. I had a couple drinks before i realized it i'm like what turbulence. If i could have tipped these two I would but they were not allowed to take tips. Kara and Jay you guys were awesommmmeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee sauce and I appreciate you all so so so so so so so very much and I wish them best of luck.,Positive
"Our last 2 experiences with Delta have really helped restore my faith in humanity. About a month and a half ago, my wife and 6 y/o daughter missed their flight due to weather and terrible traffic. Long story short, they were put on the next flight. My wife asked if they needed her card number and the girl in customer service said, “We're not gonna charge you.” I almost fell over. A few days ago, there was a mix up in flights (again it was OUR mistake, not Delta’s). We were traveling with our 2 children and my mother in law. Luckily we called ahead to confirm. Turns out, my mother in law was departing out of a different airport. Again, they fixed the issue (the DAY before the flight no less) and AGAIN, didn’t charge us. After these experiences, I would HIGHLY recommend Delta to anyone. Keep it up! Unfortunately, we threw the paper out with these awesome employees’ names.",Negative
"Since 2009 I have flown to Philippines for personal and business purposes. After using multiple airlines, Delta comes out on top for superior customer service. The staff are clearly motivated, engaged, and interested in any passenger needs. I appreciate so much that about every hour or so there are staff up and down the aisles offering drinks and one can always go to the kitchen area for more if needed. And the meals and snacks seem to keep coming at just the right intervals.",Positive
"Sadly the performance on partner Korean Air fails to meet Delta standards and on their flights I feel I'm dying of need for food or drink long before it's offered and the staff at the Korean Air gate act as if Delta ticket holders are imposters. I've been using Korean Air lately because I'm most comfortable with seat choice on the 747 and mourn the loss of that plane from your Delta fleet -- guess I'm just old fashioned but there is something irreplaceably comforting about a 747 4 engine aircraft with such an impeccable and decades long safety record. As a repeat flyer I would gladly pay extra for a Delta 747 seat to help pay for the higher fuels costs -- couldn't you reconsider its demise and offer it as a special option? Anyway, many thanks for your ongoing top performance and yes I will continue to fly Delta and partners.",Negative
"Highly recommend, the best company, excellent in customer service. My daughter booked two trips next month from American Airline and Delta. When I did change today, the two companies response are totally different. Delta customer service is excellent, they respond to the phone call immediately, an agent on phone resolving the issue with a warm heart, do the best assistant me, you will feel the world is beautiful because there are beautiful people.",Positive
"Amerian Airline customer service is horrible. It not just waiting for 30 minutes to get a response. Also the agent on the phone is heartless, Cold. The ticket is $1200. The agent refuses correction ticket, credit or refund. The flight schedule is a half month from today, make me total confuse, it is a conspiracy that big company (AA) cheater customers and take advantage of consumers. The response from Both Airline Company, The Result is: AA is the worst Airline Company. Delta is the best company, they are beautiful people and make the world a beautiful Place to live. Highly Recommend!!",Negative
"I only gave a 1 because that was the only option, otherwise I would have left that part blank. The caronavirus is everywhere. Nobody planned for this. My mother and I had booked our flights a while back and we are supposed to be going April 15th. We decided we shouldn’t be flying even if everything is cleared up at that time. I just started a new job and was approved for vacation when I was hired. I will not have a vacation by the time their credit that they were offering was going to expire. We asked if they could make an exception and they wouldn’t.",Negative
"Pretty sad that other companies have refunded a few friends of mine that were supposed to be traveling. Even Allegiance refunded one of my friends. Delta is a very well known airline, you’d think they’d care a little more about their customers instead of trying to hoard the money. Now I get to pay into their payroll and now also get to rent a car to drive down to South Carolina from New York. Keepin it classy delta, keepin it classy.",Negative
"I bought tickets to Florida in order to go to a couple of spring training baseball games. When the games were cancelled I attempted to go anyway. Domestic travel has been strongly discouraged and I had to cancel. Delta kept 1/2 of the fees, $600, and credited me for the other $600 towards future travel. This was beyond my control, a global pandemic. I should not be penalized for this. Next time I will drive.",Negative
My wife and I purchased 1st class tickets many months ago prior to the Corona-virus outbreak. My wife became very sick with a nasty sinus infection and as the Corona-Virus was in full swing many people began cancelling trips. I am close to 70 years old and felt it was not a good idea for my sick wife or myself to travel at this time. This was an unusual experience as I am sure it was for everybody. Our flight down to Nashville was with Jetblue. They immediately refunded our money with no problem.,Negative
"When calling Delta it took 2 hours of waiting time to get through and a ridiculous battle to get them to refund our money. They fought me every inch of the way. They beat me down to a point that I finally took what they offered which was 100 buck per ticket which was a total of a 200 dollar loss. We felt that under these condition they would simply refund our money our of good faith. I will never fly Delta and would NOT recommend to anybody to use them. Remember my wife was very sick and the Corona-Virus was in full swing. Seems like it would have simply been the right thing to do. I received refunds from all hotels, and Jetblue with no problem at all. Delta, You have not behaved in an honorable way and people will not forget this.",Negative
"The app worked great for awhile, but now I cant even look into booking a flight. If you put in an airport in the from and to sections, it stays blank. The number one feature, being able to book or check out potential rates and prices, is unusable. The app was never great, but if it fails to perform its primary function, then it is trash. Just use the website.",Negative
"Showed up a few hours early trying to get on a earlier flight. I went and spoke to the person (Holly **) a asked if there were any available seats that I may get home to my family sooner. She stated that there wasn't. However, I hung around to wait till everyone boarded to take my chances. I waited and watched as she sat the 3 standbys and heard her state that she did have 2 more empty seats. At this point I asked again. She denied me because she didn't want to do the key entries to add me to the flight. I could understand if there were no seats but she simply did not want to do the extra few key punches. This is just ridiculously unacceptable. So you have empty seats and you just chose not to add me to the flight cause you didn't feel like it. Most disrespectful thing I have ever experienced. Won't be flying Delta again.",Negative
"Spent the day on 3/12 trying to cancel a flight. Given the current climate, the hold time was 6 hours long. I was notified at 1pm that the event I was going to in Las Vegas was cancelled. Was able to easily cancel the hotel with no issue online. Sat on the phone for several hours to no avail. Tried utilizing the website but that did not work. Called this morning 3/13 sat on the phone for 2 hours. Finally got through to someone. I was told no refunds only flight credits... Flight credits for 5 people who will not ever clearly be traveling again. I get you are trying to stave off the tail spin of your stock plummeting, but do right by your customers. I frequently fly and was thinking of applying for your credit card. I already hold the American Airlines Elite card. But not after this experience. I also have time and resources to fight to get my money back and ""fend for the little guy"". I assure you, you went to war with the wrong person. :-) Delta **.",Negative
"Please do not call to get information about changing your flight because of the coronavirus. I merely asked to know Delta policy should I need to change my flight due to the virus. After he told me about the $300.00 change fee he then said It must be done on this call or not at all. All I wanted was info and I told him that immediately. He said it was on this call or not at all. I am 79 years old and I thought I was being cautious but instead I got punished. He said they are not allowed to reveal that information at the start of the call. Very shady, very disappointed with Delta.",Negative
Delta Air Lines was great. Their customer service was wonderful. My flight was great even though I missed it due to changes at the terminal. I recommend them. We should have more airlines like this.,Positive
"We purchased travel tickets to Eugene Oregon, scheduled to leave on Friday. Layover in Seattle. Because of our concern over the Coronavirus our family as well as ourselves decided to cancel our trip. Delta refused to refund the ticket price because The Coronavirus did not meet their selected criteria for refunds. So they expect us to fly into a city where a good number of major companies have chosen to let their employees work from home, where the school system is contemplating closing schools, where 11 people have died from this virus. I guess it’s all about the Benjamins.",Negative
I called and spoke to several people needing to reschedule a flight for my son to come home from College on Spring Break. He play for the school basketball team and they are in the playoffs so he need to reschedule his departure date. I am not asking for a refund only to reschedule and I am being told NO!!!,Positive
"I fly often Delta 2nd most. They have some issues and I am locked out of my ability to log in. I changed password last week and flew logged in several times since, now they locked me out of my Sky Miles, will not tell me why they have numerous ways to verify me even answer the phone addressing me by my name. They want me to post my driver's license to their site to be able to log in. They will not tell me why. Very rude and hr wait on their phone system when you call, their phone systems prompts do not always work and they are horrible 5 hours and have nothing to show for the wasted time. What company asks for you to send non secure a driver's license photocopy to book a flight. They have numerous ways to verify me even answer the phone by my name. They recognize my phone number, Have TSA precheck Delta credit cards etc. etc.",Negative
"Booked flight with Delta online. Credit card shows pending but no confirmation with delta. Call them to enquire, they can’t find the transaction but same flight is now $160,- more expensive (all within 2 hours). Delta help can’t find transaction (even though they could charge pending amount to credit card). Bait and switch at its best....",Negative
"Booked flight through FlightHub and thought I had purchase full cancellation insurance, only to find out it was only valid for 24 hour cancellation. FlightHub told me I had to email customer service and that there would be a $50 off the top fee to cancel the seats and the rest of the refund would have to be reviewed before a credit could be issued. The flight was with Delta who had charged me for the tickets. So I called Delta and explained the medical reason for having to cancel and in just over a week, Delta gave me a full refund. Thank you Delta! I will now be reading the fine print closer when paying for cancellation insurance with any flight company.",Negative
"Two of us booked flights from Las Vegas, NV to Idaho Falls, ID with a 30 minute layover in Salt Lake City. We were asked as we were boarding if we would check our carry on item as space was not available. We said ok. They told us to pick up our carry on bags in Idaho Falls (our final destination.) Upon landing in Salt Lake City we literally ran as fast as possible from the c gate to f16, the furthest gate possible! We heard nothing on the airport announcement system about our flight. We got there with time to spare only to be told by a 'ever so graciously smiling' counter woman. She called the pilot a jerk and said he closes the doors early and refused to allow us on that flight. Miraculously she managed to get our bags off the plane but couldn't get us on?? Yeah.",Negative
"There were 0 flight options available to get us to Idaho Falls that fit our schedule. She gave us 2 $150 vouchers as if that would help. We rented a car and drove the 3 hours to Idaho Falls. The return trip was much smoother. I spoke with the customer service complaints and was refunded for the portion of the flight we were bumped from, received $200 in gift cards for other businesses and was refunded the extra cost of the car. Am I happy? Not really. It was inexcusable and stressful. My next trip will not be with Delta. The reason I gave 2 stars is because our return was ok and the customer service rep was nice.",Negative
Immediately upon sitting in our assigned seats which were located in front of the seats with the emergency exits we noticed the seats backs were positioned in a straight up position. The backs of the seats were curved so our upper backs curved into them. The head rests pushed our heads forward so that our backs were in a C shaped position and our heads hung forward. After takeoff we discovered that nothing about the seats were adjustable. They were fixed in that position for the entire site. The position we were in was not just uncomfortable but very painful both to my neck and back as well as to that of my companion.,Negative
I requested a seat change because there was a vacant seat available across and up from us. This seat was extremely comfortable. I do not feel the originally assigned seat was safe in the event of an emergency and was definitely not designed correctly. They should be removed. Better to have fewer seats that are safe rather than risk injury to cram in a few extra bodies. The other flights we experienced with Delta were positive experiences.,Negative
"I should have arrived in Sacramento from New York 8 hours ago, but instead I’m in the middle of the country being treated like cattle waiting to start the last leg of my journey. I’ll do whatever it takes to never use Delta again. They should be ashamed.",Negative
"A month prior to booking a flight, we researched the best carriers for flying your pet. After reading multiple reviews, we decided to book with Delta. (I love flying Delta and have yet to have a less than stellar experience). My husband called three times to verify all the things needed to be done for our dog prior to our flight. We spent $300 for a pre-flight vet check, as well as purchasing a kennel ($109) that met the airline’s specifications. We were told to have him to Delta Cargo four hours before the scheduled flight. Upon arrival, the temperature was 19 degrees. We were told they wouldn’t take him unless the temperature was 20 degrees, even with the required documented pet variance. We had to leave our dog with our daughter, hoping to fly him the following day.",Negative
"My husband again called Delta Cargo and whomever he spoke to said there shouldn’t be a problem getting him on a flight with the temperature above 20 degrees. Again, my daughter took him to Delta Cargo two days later and was turned away because his kennel was too small (the one we specifically bought for the airline’s specifications). They even told her Delta doesn’t fly large dogs anymore!! After speaking with Delta four times prior to this, why didn’t they even mention this!?! Save yourself a huge amount of stress and money! Don’t even consider Delta for flying your pet!",Negative
"My flight from Las Vegas was late. Delta auto changed my flight assuming I would miss the connection. The app said D32. We were in A terminal in Atlanta. We ran through airport, caught train and ran to D32. Wrong gate. The attendant, Dan, was quite rude. He would not let me finish a sentence & kept repeating ""It is what it is. Go down the hall and get help"". Followed by interruptions to say ""go on now"". The app now shows my original gate with the new time. The help desk said D32, the app says c. We went to C thinking it had changed again. No, it has the original gate with the new flight at D32. When I approached Dan about the confusion he rolled his eyes, sighed and said, ""did you talk to who I told you to talk to?"" I was sent back to the help desk.",Negative
"I am a Skymiles member and have flown for almost 20 years. The Delta app caused me to miss my flight, make me wait 4 more hours in the Atlanta airport, and the desk attendant was unprofessional and rude. A person commented ""If he doesn't like his job he should do something else"". We did not deserve any of this. I should be home already.",Negative
The exit light fiasco. To start my wife and I require assistance to get to boarding gates at airports due to her knees and my COPD. Last year we flew Delta through FLL and found a very irritable Delta staff at D8 gate. We arrived at the gate in wheelchairs and decided to give them up and walk down the ramp to board the aircraft. When pre-boarding began we started down the ramp and was stopped by one of the staff and were refused preboarding because we did not have wheelchairs. This January 26th we were sent to gate D6 to board and the same group of staff were working that corner of the terminal so we knew better than give up our wheelchairs. Delta had put two departing flights in that corner of the terminal that would both board and leave at the same time.,Negative
When it got close to boarding time naturally both gates filled with passengers to a point where both arriving flights had problems offloading. The staff lined up 18 wheelchairs at our gate including my wife and I. The mob of people was crazy and in a hurry to board as if it was first come first serve boarding. Our gate announced that there would be a 3-hour delay and our new flight time would be 4:00 PM. Delta needed a part for the plane and would have to be flown in from Atlanta to be installed. We along with 200 other passengers inquired about our connecting flights in Atlanta where we were flying too and where the part was coming from. Some were found other flights and some like us had to wait and were given alternate connections.,Negative
"At 4:00 we boarded the plane and the ""EXIT"" sign was installed. Then the crew happened to remember after 3 hours that some of the luggage had to come off of the plane and be sent to other planes which passengers had been given. So for 30 minutes more they unloaded all the luggage, sorted out the few pieces that belonged on other planes and reloaded the remaining luggage. We were finally on our way to ATL. We arrived with 10 minutes to swap to our alternate flights because we had missed our original flights. The Delta staff member in ATL had only sent 12 wheelchairs all for baggage claim. People were scrambling to find wheelchairs but there was no one to push them in Concourse A. We were heading to Concourse E and did not even have wheelchairs on our alternate flight listing. We had now missed our alternate flight to BNA.",Negative
"The attendant at the gate we landed at gave us another alternate flight to BNA via Concourse E. We had now 30 minutes to get to E and no wheelchairs. That's when a young girl found us chairs and after a while found another girl to help push us part of the way. They found another person to replace the other girl and we barely made that flight. Through the whole process, Delta employees just did not care about us. The employee in FLL did not process our assistance request and the Delta employee in ATL did not try to assist with transportation. Next time it will not be Delta that we fly.",Negative
"Flied twice in 2019 summer with Delta, both return NY flights canceled, had to change my plans and return home on second day, being routed to another city to get home. So many flights back to NYC, believe Delta overbooked all flights. Their services were horrible, gave your seats in last minutes, when asked, let you check the black screens. Opened complaints after travels, got $25 back for each person for one flight, nothing for another flight. Two cancellations caused us a few thousand dollars additionally. It was so frustrating and helpless specially when you traveled with a big group with friends and families. Will try to avoid Delta in the future as possible as we can.",Negative
"Damaged baggage procedure from the flight from January 2019 is never to end. What one should do to have it concluded. A seafarer has been dealing with this for a year now. Numerous e- mails, calls, misinformation that payment has been settled, but actually it has not, not followed up- time gaps filled with silence, family members being embarrassed over x visits to the bank and being sent back, precious work breaks spent resolving and chasing assistance, new account opened specifically for this case in order to do something from my side and still nothing. An ongoing nightmare with Delta Airlines over a single damaged luggage case. Disgrace!",Negative
"I travel as a family of 4 with 2 kids under 6 years of age. As a family we had over 400lbs of luggage allowance and we used less than half and yet the Delta staff made big fuzz about being 3-5 lbs above in a couple of luggages. So we had to bend backwards to redistribute belongings for 30 minutes. Then we get on the flight and we have again allowance to put 4 carry ons in the overhead bins and this century old attendant (just to give a sense of her experience without discrimination) gives us hard time, discrediting the allowance of the two tiny kid’s backpacks and doesn’t let me put my own backpack in the overhead. I tell her she is unreasonable and argue of my rights and she threatens to throw me off the flight!?! This is Delta, a crappy airline without sense of what service business is about and with personnel incapable of using judgement and reason.",Negative
"I am traveling with my son who has a disability. We arrived at the airport very early on a connecting flight in 3 hours that is half empty. I asked to be put on this earlier flight due to a high winds advisory in my home airport and my son's disability, which makes long waits in a busy place challengings. I provided documentation from weather.com of this advisory. Delta loses nothing by putting me on this earlier flight and only to gain my customer satisfaction. However, their customer service agents refused offering no explanation. Teresa at Montego Bay was my last conversation and she was not polite or helpful. I have routinely made similar switches to an earlier flight on Delta and other airlines even when no wind advisory existed. I will think twice about using Delta again due to this poor service.",Negative
"I booked a flight before the holidays and had to make changes, the online system would not let me so I had to call and have an agent cancel the flight. The refund never got posted to my account, which started a bunch of calls from my end and multiple agents trying to figure out what's going on. I have been given multiple conflicting stories and several apologies which still did not fix the problem. A part payment eventually went through and I had to call again and was told ""another department deals with this issue, call them"". So again more calls were made, this experience has taken close to 4 hours of my time over many calls to get this situation resolved. Delta should have much better safeguards in place for customers' returns of money. Being told that system errors are the cause are not good enough explanations and how many other times could this have happened to customers??",Negative
"Traveled from SFO to MSN (Madison, WI) through Delta. I had the connecting flight from Minneapolis−Saint Paul International Airport to MSN. Since my seat (flight DL 1309, departing at 8:40 pm from MN on 3rd of January 2020) was not allocated I went to the desk requested the woman to allocate my and my wife's seat numbers. She said she was working on that. After an hour I went back to the desk, she rudely responded back with a question, ""Did I call your name."" I was waiting for the announcement of my name and it never happened. She announced more than 20 people for seat allocation. After the Boarding announcement, I panicked and went back for seat numbers. She gave a rude look and printed 2 boarding passes with seat numbers different rows for me and my wife. When asked her she said 'thats all I can do'. I'm unable to conclude why such a bad treatment to me. Is this because I have a brown skin?",Negative
"We were scheduled to take Delta flight # 6196 at 9:10am from RDU scheduled to land at 11:26am in Ft. Lauderdale. Granted there were some weather related conditions, however our flight landed 5 hours late and we missed our cruise ship and thereby our entire family vacation for Christmas. Unfortunately, only 3 hours of the delay could be contributed to the weather as we had been told the final two hours of the delay that we could not take off due to missing crew, so the plane could not fly. Delta failed to keep passengers well informed and did not offer assistance to those that would be missing connections or their entire vacation due to the delay and lack of appropriate staffing.",Negative
"We were stranded in Ft. Lauderdale upon landing and no offer of assistance due to their delay was provided by Delta. We personally contacted Delta upon landing and placed a complaint with corporate and have not received follow up or a response. Also, our agent at American Express Travel attempted to follow up on our behalf and she was told the Delta rep was “sad,” however the entire delay was due to the weather and it was unfortunate we were told there was an issue with the crew therefore there would be no offers of compensation by Delta for our missed family vacation. Totally unacceptable. We were there. The plane was missing crew or we could have taken off two hours earlier and made our cruise ship. That is not the weather, but poor management.",Negative
"Delta “claimed” to our Amex agent that again this was all weather related and Ft. Lauderdale was closed. Maybe at some point, however in the last few hours of our delay, we heard other Ft. Lauderdale flights being called and leaving RDU...just not ours. Would be helpful if Delta was upfront, honest, and assisted their passengers as opposed to shrugging their shoulders. Not cool and there should be offers of compensation made to ALL passengers on that flight for the horrible experience. We weren’t the only family that missed the cruise ship on that flight and had their Christmas ruined.",Negative
"Originally founded as a crop-dusting company in 1924, Delta is now one of the largest airlines in the world. Each year, more than 160 million travelers fly Delta.",Positive
OMG. I did it so on October 23 this was my very first time flying. Nervous is a understatement. I about crapped my pants. Not to mention i had 4 children under the age of 10 to accompany me. As i boarded the plane it was pretty much smooth even though I did not know what to expect. At take off my 5 year old daughter screamed her lungs off i'm sure scaring other passengers.

The turbulence omg omg omg it was consistent even freaked me out more.,Negative
"Really cool app. Used it for my trip to and from hawaii. Has maps of the airports, automatic tracking of your bags, gate updates, and departure times. Only hitch I had was it kept losing my flight and I haf to re-enter confirmation info over 10 different times which can get tedius/annoying when you don't know where the hell you are. Great app otherwise.",Negative
Once the flight attendant Kara and Jay found out it was my first flight they treated me so very well. They continued to check on me and my children. I had a couple drinks before i realized it i'm like what turbulence. If i could have tipped these two I would but they were not allowed to take tips. Kara and Jay you guys were awesommmmeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee sauce and I appreciate you all so so so so so so so very much and I wish them best of luck.,Positive

"I have the same general issues that most people have had. It loses trips just about every time I travel. When I try to reenter my info it can't find the trip at all. It also carries over to the website so luckily I screen shot my boarding passes as soon as i get them. Awesome idea, terrible execution",Negative
"Our last 2 experiences with Delta have really helped restore my faith in humanity. About a month and a half ago, my wife and 6 y/o daughter missed their flight due to weather and terrible traffic. Long story short, they were put on the next flight. My wife asked if they needed her card number and the girl in customer service said, “We're not gonna charge you.” I almost fell over. A few days ago, there was a mix up in flights (again it was OUR mistake, not Delta’s). We were traveling with our 2 children and my mother in law. Luckily we called ahead to confirm. Turns out, my mother in law was departing out of a different airport. Again, they fixed the issue (the DAY before the flight no less) and AGAIN, didn’t charge us.

"This app worked great until recently. My phone crashes whenever I try to open this app now and even locks my phone up to the point of needing a hard reset. Once I uninstalled it, my phone works fine. Guess I'll have to keep in uninstalled until the issues are resolved as I'd rather have a working ph",Negative
"Poor for real needs. You think this apps main purpose is to tell you what your travel plans are and show you your ticket that you just checked in with (and check in before arrival to airport, but that's a failure too) but the app fails more than half the time. It's more frustrating to use. Just expect to use a hard copy ticket to be safe. Now, don't say I didn't warn you! Delta itself is great; it's just a bad app.",Negative
"Since 2009 I have flown to Philippines for personal and business purposes. After using multiple airlines, Delta comes out on top for superior customer service. The staff are clearly motivated, engaged, and interested in any passenger needs. I appreciate so much that about every hour or so there are staff up and down the aisles offering drinks and one can always go to the kitchen area for more if needed. And the meals and snacks seem to keep coming at just the right intervals.",Positive
"Generally 'stale', not dynamic app - fails at giving passengers up tp date info. Ex1; Does not provide or update gate information (even 30min from departure time). Ex2: cannot change flight for cancelation (though email points you to app to do so). Ex3: boarding card often reverts back to ""check in"" after you've done so - board pass unreliable when you need it.",Negative
"Sadly the performance on partner Korean Air fails to meet Delta standards and on their flights I feel I'm dying of need for food or drink long before it's offered and the staff at the Korean Air gate act as if Delta ticket holders are imposters. I've been using Korean Air lately because I'm most comfortable with seat choice on the 747 and mourn the loss of that plane from your Delta fleet -- guess I'm just old fashioned but there is something irreplaceably comforting about a 747 4 engine aircraft with such an impeccable and decades long safety record. As a repeat flyer I would gladly pay extra for a Delta 747 seat to help pay for the higher fuels costs -- couldn't you reconsider its demise and offer it as a special option? Anyway, many thanks for your ongoing top performance and yes I will continue to fly Delta and partners.",Negative
"Sometimes when you checkin on scan your boarding pass for a connecting flight, it removes your flight itinerary. I checked last night and now I have to refind my flight because it removed it. Last week after scanning my boarding pass to get through TSA it removed my flight from the app. Other than that it works, but that's an essential part of the app.",Negative
"Highly recommend, the best company, excellent in customer service. My daughter booked two trips next month from American Airline and Delta. When I did change today, the two companies response are totally different. Delta customer service is excellent, they respond to the phone call immediately, an agent on phone resolving the issue with a warm heart, do the best assistant me, you will feel the world is beautiful because there are beautiful people.",Positive
I like the Delta app. It has more options and is better than lots of other airline apps. The only thing they changed that I don't like is on the checkin it does not prompt you for bags. I always check one and many people do not so I can see why. Now I have to reopen it to check bags up front . I know I can do it on the kiosk but like to get done before I hit the airport.,Negative
"Amerian Airline customer service is horrible. It not just waiting for 30 minutes to get a response. Also the agent on the phone is heartless, Cold. The ticket is $1200. The agent refuses correction ticket, credit or refund. The flight schedule is a half month from today, make me total confuse, it is a conspiracy that big company (AA) cheater customers and take advantage of consumers. The response from Both Airline Company, The Result is: AA is the worst Airline Company. Delta is the best company, they are beautiful people and make the world a beautiful Place to live. Highly Recommend!!",Negative
Logged me out multiple times while at the airport. Had a problem where my flight arrived late and it wouldn't show my originally scheduled connecting flight. It only showed a new flight that I could switch to. Had to look up the flight and gate info manually. Gate staff assured me that I still had a seat on the flight and that my checked bag would make it on the flight as well. Luckily I didn't accept the new connecting flight like the app made me think I needed to do before I talked to the gate,Negative
"The app used to work very well. Recently (since Jan 2020) it is prone to glitches and ghost notifications. Check in gets stuck and abandon the app to check in on website. If first leg of flight requires checking in on partner airline (KLM) the app won't get past the check in and is worthless for the rest of the trip. Baggage notifications work, so 1 extra star for that. But other ghost notifications are annoyances. Attempts to work out issues with Delta chat reps had no solution. Bummer.",Negative
"I only gave a 1 because that was the only option, otherwise I would have left that part blank. The caronavirus is everywhere. Nobody planned for this. My mother and I had booked our flights a while back and we are supposed to be going April 15th. We decided we shouldn’t be flying even if everything is cleared up at that time. I just started a new job and was approved for vacation when I was hired. I will not have a vacation by the time their credit that they were offering was going to expire. We asked if they could make an exception and they wouldn’t.",Negative
"The app works for booking and getting flight information but it has some serious shortcomings: to do anything it wants confirmation number every time you do flight anything. The confirmation number is not displayed on the online boarding pass, so you have to dig through emails to find it.",Negative
"Pretty sad that other companies have refunded a few friends of mine that were supposed to be traveling. Even Allegiance refunded one of my friends. Delta is a very well known airline, you’d think they’d care a little more about their customers instead of trying to hoard the money. Now I get to pay into their payroll and now also get to rent a car to drive down to South Carolina from New York. Keepin it classy delta, keepin it classy.",Negative
"The app has worked well in terms of keeping me immediately updated of flight changes and luggage status. Unfortunately, it can't fix Delta's terrible track record I've had with them, which meant needing multiple notifications. When a flight needed rescheduled, the app came short by requiring to rebook all legs, without giving the option of only changing the connecting flight. As a result, alternative flight the same night got full by time got through to customer service to change to it.",Negative
"I bought tickets to Florida in order to go to a couple of spring training baseball games. When the games were cancelled I attempted to go anyway. Domestic travel has been strongly discouraged and I had to cancel. Delta kept 1/2 of the fees, $600, and credited me for the other $600 towards future travel. This was beyond my control, a global pandemic. I should not be penalized for this. Next time I will drive.",Negative
"This app is a crash fest and I hate it. It makes the app completely useless in a practical sense since you should NEVER depend on it. It will crash on you and leave you stranded. Hasn't happened to me because I don't trust technology already, but I'm leaving this for anyone who is trying to be all in the 21st century and do everything mobile. The website isn't much better either.",Negative
"I am traveling with kids. Upon landing a push notification shows the carousel number. I click it, the notificatio disappears. The app opens but does not show the notification. Notifications section io theapp is empty. Moreover the whole flight is gone as historic. Aparently, creators always offboard in 5 mins and never traveled with kids",Negative
My wife and I purchased 1st class tickets many months ago prior to the Corona-virus outbreak. My wife became very sick with a nasty sinus infection and as the Corona-Virus was in full swing many people began cancelling trips. I am close to 70 years old and felt it was not a good idea for my sick wife or myself to travel at this time. This was an unusual experience as I am sure it was for everybody. Our flight down to Nashville was with Jetblue. They immediately refunded our money with no problem.,Negative
"Nice when it works. But just doesn't load my boarding pass for same day flights majority of my travels. I have to go through their website and manually type in my confirmation to have it text to me. Might be an issue with Android specifically I'm not sure. Has happened with all my devices, so I know it's not a particular phone.",Negative
"When calling Delta it took 2 hours of waiting time to get through and a ridiculous battle to get them to refund our money. They fought me every inch of the way. They beat me down to a point that I finally took what they offered which was 100 buck per ticket which was a total of a 200 dollar loss. We felt that under these condition they would simply refund our money our of good faith. I will never fly Delta and would NOT recommend to anybody to use them. Remember my wife was very sick and the Corona-Virus was in full swing. Seems like it would have simply been the right thing to do. I received refunds from all hotels, and Jetblue with no problem at all. Delta, You have not behaved in an honorable way and people will not forget this.",Negative
Rick,Positive
"Works well most of the time. Would be better with an option to read your password when typing it in, as on the website version. Would also be better to automatically save the boarding passes to the phone such that it is not necessary to login and have web access to find it again",Negative
"Showed up a few hours early trying to get on a earlier flight. I went and spoke to the person (Holly **) a asked if there were any available seats that I may get home to my family sooner. She stated that there wasn't. However, I hung around to wait till everyone boarded to take my chances. I waited and watched as she sat the 3 standbys and heard her state that she did have 2 more empty seats. At this point I asked again. She denied me because she didn't want to do the key entries to add me to the flight. I could understand if there were no seats but she simply did not want to do the extra few key punches. This is just ridiculously unacceptable. So you have empty seats and you just chose not to add me to the flight cause you didn't feel like it. Most disrespectful thing I have ever experienced. Won't be flying Delta again.",Negative
The app crashed right before I had to scan my boarding pass. It also wiped out all of my trips. Tried logging out and could not log back in. Tried resetting password the email arrived 15 minutes late. Your password cannot be the same as the last one! I just tried logging in with but it told me it's invalid. Anyway after logging back in my trips are still not showing up even though I see receipts for them.,Negative
"When it's working, it's great. Unfortunately, seems to not work about 80% of the time. Especially if you have connecting flights. Tracks the first leg fine. After that I start getting messages that my information can't be found and try again later. Once that happens you're screwed as far as finding your information. Doing an uninstall and reinstalling does no good. If you just want flight information it's pretty good, but if you want to track your information such as seat assgn. it's frustrating",Positive
"Spent the day on 3/12 trying to cancel a flight. Given the current climate, the hold time was 6 hours long. I was notified at 1pm that the event I was going to in Las Vegas was cancelled. Was able to easily cancel the hotel with no issue online. Sat on the phone for several hours to no avail. Tried utilizing the website but that did not work. Called this morning 3/13 sat on the phone for 2 hours. Finally got through to someone. I was told no refunds only flight credits... Flight credits for 5 people who will not ever clearly be traveling again. I get you are trying to stave off the tail spin of your stock plummeting, but do right by your customers. I frequently fly and was thinking of applying for your credit card. I already hold the American Airlines Elite card. But not after this experience. I also have time and resources to fight to get my money back and ""fend for the little guy"". I assure you, you went to war with the wrong person. :-) Delta **.",Negative
"Delta's app and website are terrible. It never remembers your info even though you've checked the box to do so. Then once you've typed in the password; correctly i might add, multiple times, it doesn't work. Reset the password, doesn't work. I wanted to book a vacation with them. Got fed up and book",Negative
Not sure about Delta Air Lines?,Positive
Take our two minute quiz to find the right Airlines for you.,Positive
I downloaded this because I am visually impaired and was escorted to the wrong gate by the porter on my first flight. So my return home flight I wanted to make sure I was in charge. This app updated real time and kept me informed of where I needed to go. I loved the airport maps. Because of this I made my flight in less than 45 minutes by myself through Atlanta airport! Thank you at least to Delta app,Positive
"Please do not call to get information about changing your flight because of the coronavirus. I merely asked to know Delta policy should I need to change my flight due to the virus. After he told me about the $300.00 change fee he then said It must be done on this call or not at all. All I wanted was info and I told him that immediately. He said it was on this call or not at all. I am 79 years old and I thought I was being cautious but instead I got punished. He said they are not allowed to reveal that information at the start of the call. Very shady, very disappointed with Delta.",Negative
"Sheesh this app is frustrating. I use this app BECAUSE I'M FLYING, focus on THAT. As others have said it frequently loses your trips requiring you to reenter you confirmation number/credit card/ticket number. It throws errors constantly. Highly unreliable. Frankly, if you can't get it right for those already flying why in the world would I trust your system to book/buy something else? There are a thousand ways to buy what I want, start by getting it right for those who are already flying.",Negative
"Trips disappear. Every single trip I've used this app for, the trip has disappeared from the app at some point. Usually more than once. Then I need to find my reservation number and search for it again to get my boarding pass. This is very frustrating, it would be great if this was fixed up. Otherwise the app is very good.",Negative
Delta Air Lines was great. Their customer service was wonderful. My flight was great even though I missed it due to changes at the terminal. I recommend them. We should have more airlines like this.,Positive
"Used to be good. It dropped out and asked for my username and password to log back in. I entered it but it said I got it wrong, so I went on with my computer and I was able to get in no problem... now I have to get the gate agent to print out my tickets. This just adds stress to an already long stressful day of traveling!",Negative
"Found a perfect flight, selected all my options, went to pay. Input all my information, and it told me I was missing some information. Nothing was left blank, nothing was highlighted in red. Tried 7 times, including starting over from scratch twice. Finally it gave me ""fatal error"" and lost my entire booking. Am not likely to use the app again.",Negative
"We purchased travel tickets to Eugene Oregon, scheduled to leave on Friday. Layover in Seattle. Because of our concern over the Coronavirus our family as well as ourselves decided to cancel our trip. Delta refused to refund the ticket price because The Coronavirus did not meet their selected criteria for refunds. So they expect us to fly into a city where a good number of major companies have chosen to let their employees work from home, where the school system is contemplating closing schools, where 11 people have died from this virus. I guess it’s all about the Benjamins.",Negative
"So the app deleted my flight info after I got into the TSA with it and I had to scramble through multiple of their emails to find the confirmation code, which was link which opened the app but also still couldn't find my flight ... had to *manually* type it in...no prob but unnecessarily complicated to do it while YOU'RE TRYING TO CATCH A FLIGHT in a crowded airport. How bout instead of focusing on things you want people to pay extra for and make the app more user friendly.",Negative
"Continually prompts you to sign into a Delta account every time you open the app. After continuing as a guest it's a game of chance whether or not the app still has your boarding pass or any trip information in it still. Do not rely on the app to have your flight information, keep it saved elsewhere and always have a printed boarding pass. Very bloated and not user friendly.",Negative
I called and spoke to several people needing to reschedule a flight for my son to come home from College on Spring Break. He play for the school basketball team and they are in the playoffs so he need to reschedule his departure date. I am not asking for a refund only to reschedule and I am being told NO!!!,Positive
"Average. I like it, like how it has the maps on most airports, but I HATE the fact that it doesn't remember my trip and every 3 times I go to pull up my trip- while in the airport or not- I have to look up my confirmation number because it doesn't have it saved. What's the point of having it if its usually easier to have a paper boarding pass and look at the screen in the airport to check flights, easier than memorizing my confirmation #!",Negative
"I have used this app for years and never had any issues until recently. TSA Precheck is not showing on my mobile device boarding pass, but it does show on the paper boarding pass when i go to the counter and have them print it. I have had this problem with the past 3 flights in a row.",Negative
"I fly often Delta 2nd most. They have some issues and I am locked out of my ability to log in. I changed password last week and flew logged in several times since, now they locked me out of my Sky Miles, will not tell me why they have numerous ways to verify me even answer the phone addressing me by my name. They want me to post my driver's license to their site to be able to log in. They will not tell me why. Very rude and hr wait on their phone system when you call, their phone systems prompts do not always work and they are horrible 5 hours and have nothing to show for the wasted time. What company asks for you to send non secure a driver's license photocopy to book a flight. They have numerous ways to verify me even answer the phone by my name. They recognize my phone number, Have TSA precheck Delta credit cards etc. etc.",Negative
"Booked flight with Delta online. Credit card shows pending but no confirmation with delta. Call them to enquire, they can’t find the transaction but same flight is now $160,- more expensive (all within 2 hours). Delta help can’t find transaction (even though they could charge pending amount to credit card). Bait and switch at its best....",Negative
"Booked flight through FlightHub and thought I had purchase full cancellation insurance, only to find out it was only valid for 24 hour cancellation. FlightHub told me I had to email customer service and that there would be a $50 off the top fee to cancel the seats and the rest of the refund would have to be reviewed before a credit could be issued. The flight was with Delta who had charged me for the tickets. So I called Delta and explained the medical reason for having to cancel and in just over a week, Delta gave me a full refund. Thank you Delta! I will now be reading the fine print closer when paying for cancellation insurance with any flight company.",Negative
"Two of us booked flights from Las Vegas, NV to Idaho Falls, ID with a 30 minute layover in Salt Lake City. We were asked as we were boarding if we would check our carry on item as space was not available. We said ok. They told us to pick up our carry on bags in Idaho Falls (our final destination.) Upon landing in Salt Lake City we literally ran as fast as possible from the c gate to f16, the furthest gate possible! We heard nothing on the airport announcement system about our flight. We got there with time to spare only to be told by a 'ever so graciously smiling' counter woman. She called the pilot a jerk and said he closes the doors early and refused to allow us on that flight. Miraculously she managed to get our bags off the plane but couldn't get us on?? Yeah.",Negative
"The app is awful! Have you ever been in a hurry because you had 40 minutes between flights, but then there were delays so you had 9? Well I have and just as I got to the gate the app decided to earse all my upcoming flight. I had to listen to a lecture about being more prepared However the biggest downfall is the way the use it. Don't send out an alert saying boarding has begun before everyone is off the plane from the previous flight.",Negative
"There were 0 flight options available to get us to Idaho Falls that fit our schedule. She gave us 2 $150 vouchers as if that would help. We rented a car and drove the 3 hours to Idaho Falls. The return trip was much smoother. I spoke with the customer service complaints and was refunded for the portion of the flight we were bumped from, received $200 in gift cards for other businesses and was refunded the extra cost of the car. Am I happy? Not really. It was inexcusable and stressful. My next trip will not be with Delta. The reason I gave 2 stars is because our return was ok and the customer service rep was nice.",Negative
"Decent app when it works. The check in function has not worked for my last three flights. This is incredibly inconvenient. When I am able to check in, the app has a tendency to crash right as I need to scan my ticket. Helpful tip- screen shot your ticket if you are lucky enough to be able to access it.",Positive
Immediately upon sitting in our assigned seats which were located in front of the seats with the emergency exits we noticed the seats backs were positioned in a straight up position. The backs of the seats were curved so our upper backs curved into them. The head rests pushed our heads forward so that our backs were in a C shaped position and our heads hung forward. After takeoff we discovered that nothing about the seats were adjustable. They were fixed in that position for the entire site. The position we were in was not just uncomfortable but very painful both to my neck and back as well as to that of my companion.,Negative
I requested a seat change because there was a vacant seat available across and up from us. This seat was extremely comfortable. I do not feel the originally assigned seat was safe in the event of an emergency and was definitely not designed correctly. They should be removed. Better to have fewer seats that are safe rather than risk injury to cram in a few extra bodies. The other flights we experienced with Delta were positive experiences.,Negative
"Good app....when it works! I have already checked in for a flight early tomorrow morning, but now the app tells me I ""have no upcoming flights"" and "" find my flight"" can't find my flight. Not the first time this has happened. Restarted the app numerous times over the last 2 hours..still not working.",Negative
"I should have arrived in Sacramento from New York 8 hours ago, but instead I’m in the middle of the country being treated like cattle waiting to start the last leg of my journey. I’ll do whatever it takes to never use Delta again. They should be ashamed.",Negative
"A month prior to booking a flight, we researched the best carriers for flying your pet. After reading multiple reviews, we decided to book with Delta. (I love flying Delta and have yet to have a less than stellar experience). My husband called three times to verify all the things needed to be done for our dog prior to our flight. We spent $300 for a pre-flight vet check, as well as purchasing a kennel ($109) that met the airline’s specifications. We were told to have him to Delta Cargo four hours before the scheduled flight. Upon arrival, the temperature was 19 degrees. We were told they wouldn’t take him unless the temperature was 20 degrees, even with the required documented pet variance. We had to leave our dog with our daughter, hoping to fly him the following day.",Negative
"My husband again called Delta Cargo and whomever he spoke to said there shouldn’t be a problem getting him on a flight with the temperature above 20 degrees. Again, my daughter took him to Delta Cargo two days later and was turned away because his kennel was too small (the one we specifically bought for the airline’s specifications). They even told her Delta doesn’t fly large dogs anymore!! After speaking with Delta four times prior to this, why didn’t they even mention this!?! Save yourself a huge amount of stress and money! Don’t even consider Delta for flying your pet!",Negative
"For the amount of dependency they're expecting users to have for this app, it is extremely unreliable and complicated to use. 2/18 -- Downgraded my vote again with this app. It is the least dependable app I have ever used. Constantly crashes. Locks you out and no one at Delta can help you when your in a hurry. Which naturally is when this app decides to screw up.",Negative
"My flight from Las Vegas was late. Delta auto changed my flight assuming I would miss the connection. The app said D32. We were in A terminal in Atlanta. We ran through airport, caught train and ran to D32. Wrong gate. The attendant, Dan, was quite rude. He would not let me finish a sentence & kept repeating ""It is what it is. Go down the hall and get help"". Followed by interruptions to say ""go on now"". The app now shows my original gate with the new time. The help desk said D32, the app says c. We went to C thinking it had changed again. No, it has the original gate with the new flight at D32. When I approached Dan about the confusion he rolled his eyes, sighed and said, ""did you talk to who I told you to talk to?"" I was sent back to the help desk.",Negative
Really good app. But should have lower ticket prices like the travel booking site. Really don't see how Jacking up prices is good for customers. When you got 1000's of flights a day and puting stacks of cash in there pockets after overhead. But when you got Greedy shareholders who wants to stuff cash in their pockets. Well there's the answer to that question of mine. And the employees are first class all the way. To the staff. Keep up the amazing work that you do.👍👍👍👍👍,Positive
"I am a Skymiles member and have flown for almost 20 years. The Delta app caused me to miss my flight, make me wait 4 more hours in the Atlanta airport, and the desk attendant was unprofessional and rude. A person commented ""If he doesn't like his job he should do something else"". We did not deserve any of this. I should be home already.",Negative
"In fairness, I still can't judge accurately, but I'll try again to see if the app still restarts after I manually Force Stop or hibernate it from a utility app, adding to the drain on the battery. Might uninstall & reinstall when needed. To Moto G5+ users w/Oreo 8 & 8.1 who reported this app useless after upgrading, Thanks for the warning. Android 7.0 stays on this G5+. Oreo ruined my other G5+'s personalizations😤😠",Negative
The exit light fiasco. To start my wife and I require assistance to get to boarding gates at airports due to her knees and my COPD. Last year we flew Delta through FLL and found a very irritable Delta staff at D8 gate. We arrived at the gate in wheelchairs and decided to give them up and walk down the ramp to board the aircraft. When pre-boarding began we started down the ramp and was stopped by one of the staff and were refused preboarding because we did not have wheelchairs. This January 26th we were sent to gate D6 to board and the same group of staff were working that corner of the terminal so we knew better than give up our wheelchairs. Delta had put two departing flights in that corner of the terminal that would both board and leave at the same time.,Negative
"This app sucks, not only does it lack basic features that the other major airlines have (such as making same day flight changes), but it is also pretty confusing to use. I am in my twenties so naturally I am pretty good with technology and apps, but this one manages to confuse me at times.",Positive
When it got close to boarding time naturally both gates filled with passengers to a point where both arriving flights had problems offloading. The staff lined up 18 wheelchairs at our gate including my wife and I. The mob of people was crazy and in a hurry to board as if it was first come first serve boarding. Our gate announced that there would be a 3-hour delay and our new flight time would be 4:00 PM. Delta needed a part for the plane and would have to be flown in from Atlanta to be installed. We along with 200 other passengers inquired about our connecting flights in Atlanta where we were flying too and where the part was coming from. Some were found other flights and some like us had to wait and were given alternate connections.,Negative
"At 4:00 we boarded the plane and the ""EXIT"" sign was installed. Then the crew happened to remember after 3 hours that some of the luggage had to come off of the plane and be sent to other planes which passengers had been given. So for 30 minutes more they unloaded all the luggage, sorted out the few pieces that belonged on other planes and reloaded the remaining luggage. We were finally on our way to ATL. We arrived with 10 minutes to swap to our alternate flights because we had missed our original flights. The Delta staff member in ATL had only sent 12 wheelchairs all for baggage claim. People were scrambling to find wheelchairs but there was no one to push them in Concourse A. We were heading to Concourse E and did not even have wheelchairs on our alternate flight listing. We had now missed our alternate flight to BNA.",Negative
"The attendant at the gate we landed at gave us another alternate flight to BNA via Concourse E. We had now 30 minutes to get to E and no wheelchairs. That's when a young girl found us chairs and after a while found another girl to help push us part of the way. They found another person to replace the other girl and we barely made that flight. Through the whole process, Delta employees just did not care about us. The employee in FLL did not process our assistance request and the Delta employee in ATL did not try to assist with transportation. Next time it will not be Delta that we fly.",Negative
"The app has dropped my ""trip"" twice now, while I'm traveling with the trip... Forcing me to switch to paper tickets, when the app is supposed to eliminate that... Also it doesn't indicate TSA pre check... What is the purpose of an app if it doesn't even do the basic things its supposed to do... Ie show an electronic ticket with all pertinent information",Negative
"Flied twice in 2019 summer with Delta, both return NY flights canceled, had to change my plans and return home on second day, being routed to another city to get home. So many flights back to NYC, believe Delta overbooked all flights. Their services were horrible, gave your seats in last minutes, when asked, let you check the black screens. Opened complaints after travels, got $25 back for each person for one flight, nothing for another flight. Two cancellations caused us a few thousand dollars additionally. It was so frustrating and helpless specially when you traveled with a big group with friends and families. Will try to avoid Delta in the future as possible as we can.",Negative
"Keeps saying I hit my limit on password entries even right after I update my password, so it's an endless cycle. I have better luck going directly to the site via a browser.",Positive
What a horrible experience to have your boarding passes all loaded up then as you race to your next flight and you open this app to find the boarding passes are gone and you have to go hunting for your confirmation email or see an attendant. Of all the airline apps I use I have never seen this other than on Delta.,Negative
"Damaged baggage procedure from the flight from January 2019 is never to end. What one should do to have it concluded. A seafarer has been dealing with this for a year now. Numerous e- mails, calls, misinformation that payment has been settled, but actually it has not, not followed up- time gaps filled with silence, family members being embarrassed over x visits to the bank and being sent back, precious work breaks spent resolving and chasing assistance, new account opened specifically for this case in order to do something from my side and still nothing. An ongoing nightmare with Delta Airlines over a single damaged luggage case. Disgrace!",Negative
"I've used the app for 3 trips, so far. At the end of two of them, in My Trips, my trip info had been cleared as if my trip is over. I'm currently reviewing this app while waiting for my bag. I can't use the app to find my bag, because the app thinks my trip is over. Edit: still useless upon arrival",Negative
Was not able to Check-in through the app for either of my flights. When I got to the airport it dropped all of my saved trip information and I had to reload it. I preselected seats for my return flight a week in advance and the morning of my flight they changed on the app. Do not even bother with this.,Negative
"I travel as a family of 4 with 2 kids under 6 years of age. As a family we had over 400lbs of luggage allowance and we used less than half and yet the Delta staff made big fuzz about being 3-5 lbs above in a couple of luggages. So we had to bend backwards to redistribute belongings for 30 minutes. Then we get on the flight and we have again allowance to put 4 carry ons in the overhead bins and this century old attendant (just to give a sense of her experience without discrimination) gives us hard time, discrediting the allowance of the two tiny kid’s backpacks and doesn’t let me put my own backpack in the overhead. I tell her she is unreasonable and argue of my rights and she threatens to throw me off the flight!?! This is Delta, a crappy airline without sense of what service business is about and with personnel incapable of using judgement and reason.",Negative
"One of the best airline apps I've come across. I'd still suggest taking a screenshot of your boarding pass or better yet, printing it on paper as a precaution, but I've had no problems with it and I've used it for every function. The boarding notification is also very useful.",Negative
"Why does the app have to crash every time someone asks to see my boarding pass? Even the Delta staff joke that you are better off taking a screenshot than relying on the app... Other than that, the app is really great! ..have you guys tried testing the app before releasing?",Negative
"I am traveling with my son who has a disability. We arrived at the airport very early on a connecting flight in 3 hours that is half empty. I asked to be put on this earlier flight due to a high winds advisory in my home airport and my son's disability, which makes long waits in a busy place challengings. I provided documentation from weather.com of this advisory. Delta loses nothing by putting me on this earlier flight and only to gain my customer satisfaction. However, their customer service agents refused offering no explanation. Teresa at Montego Bay was my last conversation and she was not polite or helpful. I have routinely made similar switches to an earlier flight on Delta and other airlines even when no wind advisory existed. I will think twice about using Delta again due to this poor service.",Negative
"I'm logged in but it keeps forgetting my trip. I've put in my name and confirmation more than 5 times, my app remembers it for a few days or a few hours and then I have to put in all my info again. I'm flying out tomorrow and I will not rely on the app for my boarding passes",Negative
I used to use delta app 3-4years ago and it was great. Recently started to fly them again and the app won't keep me logged it or pull up my flights unless I use my record locator each time. Very frustrating.,Positive
"I booked a flight before the holidays and had to make changes, the online system would not let me so I had to call and have an agent cancel the flight. The refund never got posted to my account, which started a bunch of calls from my end and multiple agents trying to figure out what's going on. I have been given multiple conflicting stories and several apologies which still did not fix the problem. A part payment eventually went through and I had to call again and was told ""another department deals with this issue, call them"". So again more calls were made, this experience has taken close to 4 hours of my time over many calls to get this situation resolved. Delta should have much better safeguards in place for customers' returns of money. Being told that system errors are the cause are not good enough explanations and how many other times could this have happened to customers??",Negative
"When it works it's fine, but frequently loses track of upcoming trips. Frustrating when you're about to board and suddenly no longer have a boarding pass.",Negative
"Will continue to be one star until Google Pay support is added. It's basically functional otherwise, but no Google pay support is incredibly inconvenient and considering they support apples wallet app it's down right infuriating.",Positive
"Traveled from SFO to MSN (Madison, WI) through Delta. I had the connecting flight from Minneapolis−Saint Paul International Airport to MSN. Since my seat (flight DL 1309, departing at 8:40 pm from MN on 3rd of January 2020) was not allocated I went to the desk requested the woman to allocate my and my wife's seat numbers. She said she was working on that. After an hour I went back to the desk, she rudely responded back with a question, ""Did I call your name."" I was waiting for the announcement of my name and it never happened. She announced more than 20 people for seat allocation. After the Boarding announcement, I panicked and went back for seat numbers. She gave a rude look and printed 2 boarding passes with seat numbers different rows for me and my wife. When asked her she said 'thats all I can do'. I'm unable to conclude why such a bad treatment to me. Is this because I have a brown skin?",Negative
"Delta is the best. I have access to Alaska, American, United, etc. I always compare prices and Delta consistently beats the competition on both price and value. Unfortunately, downgraded my 5- star rating, the wifi on the past two Delta flights hasn't worked after I paid $32 to access the wifi.",Positive
Constantly resets and have to enter my confirmation number again and again even though the app should be able to find my trips based on my profile information. Boarding pass disappears every time the app refreshes. Not surprising since airlines in America don't really give a darn about customer service.,Negative
"We were scheduled to take Delta flight # 6196 at 9:10am from RDU scheduled to land at 11:26am in Ft. Lauderdale. Granted there were some weather related conditions, however our flight landed 5 hours late and we missed our cruise ship and thereby our entire family vacation for Christmas. Unfortunately, only 3 hours of the delay could be contributed to the weather as we had been told the final two hours of the delay that we could not take off due to missing crew, so the plane could not fly. Delta failed to keep passengers well informed and did not offer assistance to those that would be missing connections or their entire vacation due to the delay and lack of appropriate staffing.",Negative
"""Sorry, the app is having technical difficulties. Please try again. "" I tried everything ten times and it never worked. So I have zero functionality.",Negative
"We were stranded in Ft. Lauderdale upon landing and no offer of assistance due to their delay was provided by Delta. We personally contacted Delta upon landing and placed a complaint with corporate and have not received follow up or a response. Also, our agent at American Express Travel attempted to follow up on our behalf and she was told the Delta rep was “sad,” however the entire delay was due to the weather and it was unfortunate we were told there was an issue with the crew therefore there would be no offers of compensation by Delta for our missed family vacation. Totally unacceptable. We were there. The plane was missing crew or we could have taken off two hours earlier and made our cruise ship. That is not the weather, but poor management.",Negative
"Delta “claimed” to our Amex agent that again this was all weather related and Ft. Lauderdale was closed. Maybe at some point, however in the last few hours of our delay, we heard other Ft. Lauderdale flights being called and leaving RDU...just not ours. Would be helpful if Delta was upfront, honest, and assisted their passengers as opposed to shrugging their shoulders. Not cool and there should be offers of compensation made to ALL passengers on that flight for the horrible experience. We weren’t the only family that missed the cruise ship on that flight and had their Christmas ruined.",Negative
"Strange that so many people are having trouble with this app, because mine works perfectly. I absolutely love it. It's a great travel sidekick and even keeps track of my bags. My favorite flight app, developed for my all time favorite airline.",Positive
"The app was great but the update often shows no flights at crucial times such as when making a connection. Also my husband and I have 2 different sky miles accounts yet his flights and boarding passes show in his and mine, on 2 separate phones. Something is wrong.",Positive
"It has all the functions it should, but it is consistently forgetting my trips. I'll be in the middle of a trip looking for my connecting flight info and be forced to re enter my information multiple times per trip. Extremely annoying.",Negative
"Over the last few trips it asks me to check in, then usually tells me it's broken or I'm not allowed to check in because of my ticket type. Don't ask me to check in using the app if I can't check in using the app.",Negative
"Terrible app. Its 2020 why do you still need my confirmation number to find my trips? Show me what I've booked already. Your app is terrible. Southwest can show me upcoming trips, why is your app so far behind? No funding? Do better.",Negative
Why does it not show my purchased trips if I'm logged in? Why do I have to search for confirmation number etc. Such a dumb app. Where is the flexible dates option for booking flights?,Negative
"Exceptional application, informs you of everything you need to know about your flight, baggage loading, boarding time and which gate your flight is arriving and departing. A++ One of the many reasons I fly Delta.",Negative
Garbage! What is wrong with these people at Delta? How can it possibly be a good idea to disallow access to my upcoming flight info within the app? I have to go over to my email to retrieve a confirmation number every time? What? Get a clue guys! Wake up!,Negative
It's Delta with a d not fly with an f when I look for this app. All searching by fly does is make me a annoyed. Tell the marketing genius who thought about that it doesn't actually trick anyone into flying more,Negative
"Often flight info just disappears forcing to use ""Find My Trip"" again. Unable to view seat availability when flight is operated by a partner airlines.",Negative
"Great app but 1 star because it keeps removing my boarding pass when I need it most, right before my flight. I have to keep adding in the conformation code. I'll give 5 stars once fixed.",Negative
"Replacing humans. Delta is pushing this app as a convenience. But when the app says they cancelled your flight, and wait times are over an hour on the phone... How is this app helpful? Delta, we want to talk with real humans. Truthfully, delta appears best shamed into response on Twitter. Which is super sad... That only public lambasting can spur them to response. But at least there is a human on Twitter. Even if only one for every ten conversations.",Negative
Never fails to lose my boarding pass once I get to the Airport. Make sure you screenshot as soon as it displays. Pure garbage.,Negative
"I am a Sky Miles member. I am using this app for the first time. I am traveling tomorrow. I am checked in and feel great! Using the app takes away stress of travel. I also fly needs assistance, so I can be sure there will be travel assistance at every leg of my flights! Thank you, Delta! You are the best!!!",Positive
"Awful. The main reason for getting the app is the boarding pass. You get to the gate to find ""my trips"" is empty. What a failure!",Negative
Same issue as other people... The app doesn't save your flight info. When you open the app you have to type in the reference # and last name over and over again. Very silly.,Negative
Disappointed experience - App refuses to let me login using credentials I updated on the website. If a user can login to one using a mobile device they should be automatically logged into the other.,Negative
Slow to update and receive data. I lose my boarding pass to often and have to wait after it kicks me out.,Negative
Not bad does well with standard flights but once flights are delayed the info is unreliable and the system handles these changes very poorly. The only reason i can't give this app a 5 star.,Positive
"This app made my first time flying in years much easier and about hassle free . Lots of notifs and updates on flight details, let's you know when it's boarding as well !",Positive
Does not remember trips on the app. Also the search function for previous trips to add miles does not work.,Negative
"App still doesn't remember password, and makes me reset password almost every time I try to log in. Probably the worst travel app I have ever used by a major airline or hotel.",Negative
"My boarding pass vanished from the app multiple times within an hour, leaving me to scramble as I boarded, what exactly is the point of this app?",Negative
"When it works, it's fine. Keep getting locked out and account froze. App drops intermittently usually at boarding when I'm trying to display my boarding pass.",Negative
"GET A BOARDING PASS. Not reliable, fails all the time. Your flights will falsely change on the application. Gives false boarding gates.",Negative
If I could do 0 I would. I cant even login on the app; I have to go through the website to check-in. Very dissatisfying.,Negative
Came back to rate 1 star. This app will delete your boarding pass at any time for no reason sometimes right at TSA. Today it was deleted at the gate during scan.,Negative
"Horrible. All it ever says is, The App is having technical difficulty. Useless app and you certainly can't rely on it for your boarding pass.",Negative
Great when it works. When you change your password you are automatically locked out of the app for 24 hours.,Positive
Why doesn't it save boarding passes to Google Pay? Also why does it exit the app when I press the back button? So irritating.,Positive
This app is useless. My boarding passes arbitrarily disappear when I need to use them and as do the notifications as soon as I open them in the app. It is actually useless.,Negative
This app has so many nice touches. My favourite example: weather in your destination is shown in Farenheit. Tap the number and it changes to Celsius. Delightful!,Negative
"Won't allow me to login. I even reset my login information, nothing. Completely useless.",Negative
The app of the year for technical difficulties. An almost useless app. Most disappointing.,Negative
App keeps dropping my trips and randomly my boarding passes. Really annoying when at security or when boarding.,Negative
Doesn't work half of the time . I have to put all my info in each time I use it and then it forgets it then I got to do it again,Negative
"Used to use this app all the time, but now crashes upon opening and doesn't work at all. LG V40",Negative
"Used to use this app all the time, but now crashes upon opening and doesn't work at all. LG V40",Negative
"Tracking map will not work when looking at flight status... when clicked, it says app is not working and exits out of the entire app.",Negative
"Worthless, bidding pass disappears just when you actually need it at the gate.",Positive
Locked me out of my account for 24 hours on an international travel day when I used valid login credentials. Ridiculous. QC -heard of it?,Negative
The app continues to get better! When will you add the ability to save my BP to Google Pay? Why do you only support this kind of feature for iOS?,Negative
App couldn't even open for some months now. Scrap it and introduce a better App. Its a disgrace to Delta's HIGH STANDARD in the Airline business.,Negative
"Terrible at finding the flights, use the same information online at get instant results.",Positive
Glitchy. Forces you to enter confirmation number repeatedly instead of just remembering your trip.,Negative
Unable to log in on the mobile app even though I use the exact same login info on my desktop without a problem,Negative
Could use some improvements but probably the best airline app of the US airlines. Delta doesnt seem to take feedback.,Positive
Was unable to use on Samsung Tab A. Every time I came to a drop down menu it would kick me back to the beginning.,Positive
Useless app. never worked once nothing but problems.Had to just call them. Don't waste your time!!!!!,Negative
"Terrible to find the flight,  information online at get instant results.",Negative
Unable to view boarding passes for my flights MNL > NRT > ATL > MSY. and also unable to message via app.,Negative
Worst App again.... Automatically shuts down. What's up Delta? Don't want any more business?,Negative
My ticket disappeared and my confirmation no. Wouldn't work AFTER I already checked in.,Positive
"Horrible experience!! Errors while booking international trip of 4 people, Credit card being charged $4.5K × 3, one for each error, no confirmation email and most importantly, NO ONE CONTACTED ME TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AFTER EMAILING CUSTOMER SERVICE COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT!!!!",Negative
App works fine except for sky club. When I select an airport the app closes. Galaxy S9,Positive
"Hangs and crashes all the time, unreliable app from otherwise reliable air carrier.",Negative
My flight information just dissapears during layovers when there's a delay.,Positive
"Boarding passes disappear randomly. Seriously, you had one job...",Negative
Useless PoC. You can immediately tell it never went through user testing. Blocking an account for trying to log in is the most stupid thing I've seen. And making the user CALL?? An airline??? I'd rather NOT fly Delta.,Negative
"Don't log in as guest, as it may forget your boarding pass.",Positive
"This app just randomly loses your data, and crashes.",Positive
Boarding passes only show up half the time.,Negative
i wish there was a button when youre on your way but about to miss your flight lol . makes you go to website to get # but overall great,Negative
