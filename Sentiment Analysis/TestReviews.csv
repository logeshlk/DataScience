Review,Sentiment
Won't let me check in. I thought the most recent update fixed this but I guess not.,
I type in the booking reference and the app crashes. I can't check in. This app experience is reflective of my enter experience with the airline.,
"This new App sucks, I am a frequent flyer with AC 75K status, so no one can argument with me reagarding this like I am new to it or etc. The previous app had more options. And this one is just garbage.",
Doesn't work... won't find my reservations... hopefully the flight is better,
Nov 2019 Unstable app! So many crashes. So hard to get my reservations sync on it and when I dot often it just disappear. Forget to have your boarding passes on it.. also it seems you can't see neither change your seat beside during the check in process,
"Just go to the mobile website, this app sucks. Wont let you check in, boarding passes work once in a while. It's just a slow goofy, semi functioning app. If they made some tweaks and things worked properly, it would be a great app",
"Error - 1022 We can't search for flights, because of this error, which makes the app useless for me.",
"Even if someone hires an app developer and pays him/her 10K to build an worse app than this one, he/she won't be able to. This is useless app. Booking information doesn't show up. It doesn't throw flight status nor alerts. I don't understand why Air Canada keeps this app. Because they have to?",
"11/30/19 Update: This update caused a duplication of all trips in the app. In addition, I can't even check in for a flight. Hey AC...how come your app updates create problems for the user instead of improving the app?",
"OK... I upgraded the rating to 3 stars. To their credit they added the integration that went missing. My original 1 star comment was as follows: Imagine taking a perfectly acceptable app and then ""upgrading"" it by taking away all the integration, automation and intuitiveness.",
"Often, it wont recognize my booking reference code. Sometimes the boarding pass doesn't load properly on screen for security to scan. The layout and ability to view past trips and boarding passes is not well thought out.",
"Forced to update, then wouldn't let me check in, saying had to see an agent. Used my wife's phone and the old app which thankfully still worked! The old app was great, the new one, garbage! Why change it if your not improving it?",
"Congratulations Air Canada. You managed to make the app worse and call it an upgrade. I guess you need it that way to go hand in hand with your passenger flight experience. Believe me when i say that if there was an option to your airline and app, you would not make the cut.",
I really like the previous interface. It was a big upgrade from the old app and yet the new interface had some welcome user friendly UI additions. What I don't understand is why some useful features were taken away such as integrating itinerary into the Calendar app and being able to change payment/personal info in the app rather than getting redirected to a browser.,
"For the amount that Air Canada charges, you'd figure they could make an app that works properly and is more intuitive. At a minimum, maybe an app that doesn't boot you off without warning.",
Terrible new version. I feel lost looking for my flight. Air Canada go and get your money back from whomever scammed you into developing this. A good damage control measure is to go back to the old one.,
"App had Air Canada flight from LHR to YYZ as a United flight, so couldn't check in. Tried phoning, sending messages via Facebook Messenger and DM tweet and no responses. Subsequently missed the flights. Thanks for nothing Air Canada for the appalling customer service and rubbish app!",
"Since they moved to the new platform, the app has improved, but it now shows annoying messages about the need to update, which lead to nowhere, since Google store already made auto update. Otherwise, functionality is there.",
This new version is almost unusable. The previous one was super user friendly and had all the information you could possibly need. If it's not broke please don't fix it. The last version I would give 5 stars .,
"Where is the Rouge player? What happened to the saved info that auto populates when you check in? Couldn't even check in, had to check in through AC life. This app is glitchy, I liked the old version way better. Fix it guys!",
"This update was not the best. Everything is hard to find now, and not really intuitive. It shouldn't be so hard to find your current active boarding pass - the one thing you really need from the app.",
Doesn't recognize reservation codes. Can't see my boarding passes in the app. The previous app was much better.,
"Doesn't work anymore Can't add trips, keeps saying it's a problem on their end. Anything I try to do, it crashes.",
"Horrible app, can't even login!!!and don't try to call them... even worse!! They don't care about their customers. Fly WestJet",
That did you do to the app? I just opened the app today to check into my flight and the interface is different. I had to enter my booking reference just to find the flight. You should be automating everything for me. How can you go backwards. Oh and your service sucks.,
"Many options on the app, unfortunetly none is working. Always receive a message : ""sorry it's embarassing but this option don't work"". Well at least you try but next time try to put more effort in the funtionality and less in emoji in your error message",
"Have tried repeatedly to enter an existing trip so I can check in. It worked on one phone, but on another it seems impossible. I get a message saying Air Canada is embarrassed. And well it should be!",
"The new app seems to constantly lose my boarding pass for return legs. Whenever on a trip, I can only ever get access to my outbound boarding pass even though it may be from several days in the past.",
"Great flight tracking, schedules and app only features. Besides the usual schedules, alerts, booking, the are some nifty app only features like tracking the Inbound flight (know the chances of your flight getting delayed), view flight load and an offline boarding pass.",
Just badly designed. App designers clearly are not users of the app or taken into account how app is used. Finding boarding passes when you have multiple due to frequent flying is next to impossible. AC staff gate staff all apologizing.,
"It's nice to see this app keeps getting worked on, but it keeps having problems. Can't even do a simple check in. Doesn't update properly. Still shows old trips with flight being on time. And more",
"New Air Canada app won't allow bookings to be added to it. To be clear, I have to use an external travel app to keep track of my Air Canada bookings because the Air Canada app can't acknowledge bookings from its own airline.",
"Air Canada site under Google play is supposed to be updated Nov. 29 to fix any bugs, but after 5 minutes, it was still waiting for update to be downloaded. Why???",
"Used to be ok. Now it's impossible to access my altitude card, which is causing a number of issues at the airport when trying to use my status benefits.",
"Used this app the first time to check in and it's not working. Had to use browser instead. After that tried the app again to get boarding passes, and again not working.",
Jan.2nd still buggy. At times it refuses to open. Not user friendly at all.,
"What a terrible, terrible update. Where's the option to check-in with my Aeroplan number? Why do I now only have the option to check-in with my booking reference?!",
Horrible app since update....cant enter my aeroplan number. Every time i try to enter the number it logs me out instantly telling me to log back in and it does the same thing over and over again.,
"Useless app. If you want to do more than just view your itinerary and have an electronic boarding pass, forget it, just use their website and save yourself your storage space.",
"The game is fun, runs smooth and looks great. For a free mobile game it's terrific. Especially the lack of ads!!! My only real gripe is the controls are frustratingly unresponsive at times, there are a lot of swipe commands that go unnoticed, I thought maybe I need a bigger swipe, but a bigger swipe",
"Beautiful remake of the classic game! I absolutely loved playing Rayman as a kid, and was thrilled to discover that it still exists (though I am bummed that I can't find the original 1950s version). Love the gameplay design, beautiful graphics, and the wonderful music! Rayman is by far one of the best games out there, and they have done an amazing job on this version! If you want a game that is fun and challenging, get this!",
This game is perfect It looks like a compact version of rayman legends It has good controls and good graphic Although it would have been awsome if ubisoft brought more of his good games to mobile PROPERLY(ac identity was awful) For example try to bring prince of Persia back Starting with a good mobile game Well that was it Hope to see better games soon,
"Great, but gets boring when all you can to do is try to grab eggs and get out before your adventure ends in an hour. I love games like this, but i lost interest in particularly this one. It could be better",
One fantastic adventure through years. It takes you to a world of joy and dream. The music is fantastic. It suits it dreamy colorful world and the design is astonishing. Creatures are lovely and cute. Game is fantastic although ot sounds simple but it is wonderfully thrilling and enjoable to play. Thanks agsin ubisoft for this great work like you other ones.,
"The game is beautiful and imaginative. Unfortunately I didn't adapt to the controls. There should be an alternative control option where you'd move with a pad, touching the screen.",
"Could be a good game, basically a dumbed-down version of Rayman Legends. BUT, it crashes and locks up every time an ad plays, which makes it more frustrating than fun.",
I am a huge fan of Rayman and so long as you do missions and play the game and fully complete the missions it's easy to get diamonds and tickets. However I would like the channel to work.,
"Ever since I was 4 (2013-ish), I have been the biggest Rayman fan ever! I have played every Rayman game there is, especially Rayman Legends, and I used to play this on my moms iPad, so this is just nostalgic to me and Iove it to this day. Besides that, this game is beautifully made and has great music in each level with fun and adventurous gameplay! If I could, I would give it an infinity it's so good. ?",
"Used to be a nice game, moved to a new phone and downloaded.. now I get an error ""download error, please make sure you are connected to internet and try again later"" and no access anymore. After all the progress I made I don't want to have to start from the beginning. Submitted request to fix this to Ubisoft. Got instant acknowledgement of my request but no fix after 2 weeks.",
"love the game, a great version of rayman in a side scroller/run adventure game that's fun and challenging right from the start. the only thing I would change is add more control settings.",
