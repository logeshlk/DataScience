Review,Sentiment
"Worst check in process I've ever had. Every few seconds the app would stop, load something, then take me back to the starting page. The app charged me for a checked bag (got credit card notification), then said ""sorry, we could not process your order."" I had to fill in my information multiple times. It took nearly 20 minutes instead of the usual 20 seconds. Nothing loads. Half the features are broken. Tried checking in through an iPhone, that was just as bad. - I don't plan on flying Delta.",Negative
"Constantly forgets my trip that I am on despite me entering the confirmation number many many times. When I need a boarding pass and it suddenly forgets that I'm going to be flying today, that's not very helpful. By the end I had memorized my number because I had to enter it so many times. Overall slow and clunky. Love flying delta but sheeeeesh.",Negative
"Does not recognize my login/ password etc. I had restarted my password just for the sake of it although I didn't need to. I tried again, and still says credential not recognize. Just terrible.. I was this close to purchase a flight with delta. Given this hassel I don't see my self using this app nor delta in general. Fix this up Delta, I had seen you as high standard and was thinkingb of become loyal customer. But ever time having an issue logging in is not convenient",Negative
"The app is okay and does its duty... **Navigation within app** Compared to the iPhone version, I think the navigation without buttons on the bottom for easy access of My Delta/Today/etc is a bit annoying (you first need to click the burger menu, then select...) - so usability-wise, I much prefer this feature on the iPhone version. **Accessing the boarding passes** Also, please integrate a pkpass export into Google Pay (like you do for Apple Passbook), or implement at least an Android notification (starting 3 hours before the flight) that brings you directly to the Today view - which would make it much easier to quickly access the boarding pass. Looking forward to future updates - and keep climbing!",Positive
"Would be great if it works. This app has the uncanny ability to lose my reservation in the app almost every time I'm standing at the gate waiting to check in, or at passport control when I need to scan in. Suggest screenshotting your QR code boarding pass so you don't lose it at crucial moments.",Negative
The book function from the app does not work. I cannot change the destination.,Negative
"Won't even allow me to set up my account. Guess through the whole process, to then give me an error message at the very last step. I do get an email welcoming me, but when trying to log in it tells me I don't have an account. Tried setting up my account again, same issue.",Negative
I think they intentionally made it difficult to use. It forget your trip. give you a panic heart attack when you trying show your boarding pass at gate. it tell you to log in. It should not need rocket science to fix those bugs. Very annoying.,Negative
"Easy to navigate, and fast.",Positive
"Easy user interface, accurate and timely updates while in flight and at the airports. Check-in is very easy, and I screenshot the QR code temporarily in case I have connection issues when approaching security. If in flight entertainment with Delta Studio was more integrated with the app that would be nice. Downloading another app and waiting for the links to load in a separate window when selecting movies is inconvenient.",Positive
"Constantly will not show seat assignments and will give a ""oops something went wrong and to try back later"". Gold members are to be able to access to seat selection 72hrs in advance but it doesn't seem to allow that anymore, just gives error codes.",Negative
At the check mark for check-in there is larger font reads 14 hours to check-in. Lower down in smaller font it reads 1D 14 hours check-in. Make both places read the remaining time before check-in. In other time zones that could be confusing. No flight in to Philippines but app did advise me not to go to the airport. App was useless in that regard. App needs much work.,Negative
Why such important information as boarding pass is not stored locally and readily accessible? Why half of the time after I background the app I have to search for my flight again entering the confirmation number? The app has some nice features like airport map but surprisingly lack a simple convenient functionality.,Negative
"This app is GARBAGE! Do NOT use this app to check in for international flights or it will screw you and you'll have to arrive at the airport an additional 2 hours early for your flight. Or better yet, just book the flight with American, United, or any other airline that has an app that works correctly.",Negative
"Thanks for making the TSE checkmark so small on the new app interface that even with bifocals you can't see it and for making it bright red instead of blue so that you think something's wrong when you open your app. Nice changes, why don't you consider people who actually fly and use the app and make the TSA Pre sign visible to someone who just glances at their phone without their glasses on even with bifocals it's too small to see.",Negative
"If a companion is traveling in the same flight with a separate ticket, please provide the ability to tie their PNR(confirmation number) on the app so if we select seats adjacent to each other, we do not lose that because of upgrades for one of the passengers.",Positive
"Update: latest version still has the same bug. Pretty good app, except that when traveling with multiple passengers, it presented the wrong barcode to security. Finally tried the other barcode with their name and came up as mine on TSAs scanner, but that's a pretty serious flaw in the app!",Negative
"While the Delta App is what it is (a airline application) I haven't used it in quite some time. Today, it popped up with a notification on my phone with the title and text of ""test"". Sounds like a compromised application; no thank you. Uninstalling.",Negative
"Used to love the app. Clean UI. Gives me quick control of critical features. But then with a build this year, it gets hung loading constantly. Only resolves with closing and reopening the app then waiting. It's the one thing ruining the app.",Negative
"SUPER clunky app. Poor design. When trying to create a SkyMiles profile, I filled out all the fields before it told me my password was invalid. I had to fill the whole thing out 5 or 6 times because it kept copying info I'd filled out into the wrong fields and causing different errors.",Negative
"Get error messages when I try to reset my password. Only option is to call customer service. Locked out of account. Call customer service. ""Please say or enter your long-ass delta account number."" Pass.",Negative
Nice idea and mostly works well. Functions are too limited vs website and experience way too many errors when trying to book or purchased upgrades to seats. Don't offer a seat upgrade and then tell me you can't process it. Please fix these issues.,Negative
Very limited functionality. It also never seems to remember you username when you ck the box. It also seems to take 4 times for the password to work. It always says you have entered the wrong pw. Very poor app.,Negative
Ahh!! It's twice now that the app decides to forget my flight and boarding pass while in line. How have they not fixed the need for internet access yet? Take screenshots of your boarding passes if you use this app.,Negative
"Locked me out of my medallian account by repeatedly trying to connect with wrong password after I changed password via web site. Then told me to call customer service to unlock account, but customer service says I have to wait 24 hours after last logon attempt. Lots of bugs when it did connect.",Negative
"Often can't find your flight or say it is ""unable to find your reservation with infomation I provided"" even though the info provided is correct. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it is very frustrating.",Negative
"This app sucks compared to literally all other airline apps. Look at Alaska or United to see what a good one looks like. Delta inexplicably just seems to open your browser to their site, and is not at all tuned to mobile devices.",Negative
"This used to be one of my favorite airline app (and still is from a functionality standpoint) but ARE YOU KIDDING with the new design and color scheme? It hurts the eyes, is not consistent, light blue, dark blue, hot pink, white - what is going on??? I think there have been more than enough negative reviews complaining about the revised design - you should seriously consider reverting back.",Negative
"It's a nice app and worked for my flights... When it actually worked. There's a constant issue with it forgetting your ""trip"" so you have to enter your confirmation code over and over again (usually at the most inconvenient time). Or the app will refresh while you're using it and forget the very trip you're looking at, so you have to put your code in again. Super annoying.",Negative
"Just got a notification that only said ""test"". Now I think it's only a matter of time before I start getting notifications for ads. So the test mostly just reminded to uninstall the app.",Negative
"Buggy. Added my flights to the app, which seemed to save them. When I tried to check in, the app lost my flights. It lost them again when I tried to board. I pretty much need to type in my confirmation number each time. Also: really poor experience purchasing Wi-Fi. I bought Wi-Fi while booking a flight, and I was charged for it. The app has no record of that and even gives me the option to buy Wi-Fi for the same flight. No mention of Wi-Fi in any emails either. When I called Delta, they told me I had to call a different company.",Negative
"The app now logs me out every time I come back into it on my phone if it was already open. Having to log in every time I want to check my gate is insane. Basically use the app to open your boarding pass, then screenshot the pass, because when you try to pull up your pass at the gate, it'll log you out then have to reload the pass. If you don't want to hold up the line behind you just screenshot or print your boarding passes, cause this app is a buggy mess.",Negative
This is the worst app I've had. I cannot log into my account with it. There seems to be nice features - if I could ever use them. I can log on with my computer and through the browser on my phone - just not through the app.,Negative
"2019 Oct: I simply don't get it. Let's take this use case: I am in comfort, and 2nd on the upgrade list for 1st class. I see that there are 3 available in 1st class. I click on the seat map but it shows no available seats. However, if I go to Book, select the same date and flight, I can see the seats. WHY? Why work so hard for this info?",Negative
Love Delta (relatively to other airlines) but the app leaves a lot to be desired like actually working. Check in doesn't work half the time. ?? When you land it displays a message about where your bag is going that disappears when you try to read it. Why do I have to put in my confirmation# etc. to pull up info. Isn't not having that info whole point of using when that's the point of having the app!? Boo!,Negative
"Good when it works. Often times doesn't work. The last two days, all I can get is a notice that the app is having technical difficulties. I'm a very frequent customer of Delta and find them to be a good airline BUT a major housecleaning of the I.T. department has long been needed...for years now. C'mon Delta, hire some good professionals for the job.",Negative
Add Google Pay and face unlock functionality,Negative
"There is no option to save your boarding pass to your phone. This is important since the app randomly loses boarding passes. I was unable find the boarding pass for the flight I was boarding; the today section didn't think I had any flights, even though I had used it less than half an hour prior to go through security. I had to get out of line and punch in all my flight info, including card number, to find it. Print a paper pass as a backup.",Negative
"App ""dropped"" my boarding pass; had to be replaced with paper. I had my boarding pass in this app, and it worked without issue while I went through security. However, by the time I got to the gate, the app logged me out, and then when I re-entered my login information, it wouldn't show me my boarding pass anymore! The gate agents were willing to print me a new one -- but I had to wait in line, and it would have been faster and less stressful to just start off with a paper boarding pass.",Negative
"App is fine when it works, but in both my samsung s9 and s10+ every so often all my trips disappear. I have to retype them in one by one. Imagine how nice it is when you are boarding and your boarding pass is not there anymore... and you have to ask to print your boarding pass. From business class, you end up boarding as the last person on the flight. Plus check-in process most of the time does not get the information from the profile, forcing you to input name passport all of it ... unreliable.",Negative
"Figured by now you should be able to pull up your boarding pass anytime. Never fails, I have my boarding pass open and ready to scan, only to have my screen shut off and to turn it back on as I'm approaching the boarding doors or tsa, only to see a blank screen... This has been happening for years. I now take a screenshot because the app sucks so bad!",Negative
"Fall from Grace... The good: it's a nice looking app, colors and all. The bad: it will leave you at the gate without a way to board. Was in line, ticket showing on screen. Then boom, app refreshed, now all of my flight and everything is gone. Requires that I log in, and after, still no tickets. I'd expect more from a startup, as an experienced app developer, consumers deserve more.",Negative
"If you are flying Delta, download this app for-sure! It was incredibly helpful. Just show your boarding pass right on the phone. Gives updates on your flight status, and if your flight has a major delay, quickly gives you other flights that you can switch to with the touch of a button to get you to your destination as soon as possible. You can even track your checked luggage. I'll never fly without it. Thank you for making such a useful app!",Positive
"This app is very reliable - in the sense that anytime you know you really need it, anytime you're at the airport, you'll receive a ""technical difficulties"" error message.",Negative
The app is constantly resetting even while my boarding pass is displayed. To have the app reset and make me search for my itinerary again and again while in line for security and for boarding is a huge fail for an airline app.,Negative
"Probably one of the best airline apps available. It can be used to book, manage, upgrade flights. Good info on flight departure and arrival, including weather. Plus the feature to track your bag. ",Negative
"I have to take another star away from this app, as the latest versions now feature ""obnoxious white background"" mode. Whether you're on an overnight red-eye, a passenger in a dark car at night, or in a darkened conference room at work, prepare for the pain of being blinded while having everyone nearby glare at you with scorn as you open the Fly Delta app. This app needs a dark theme or night mode as a settings option really badly! Ugh!",Negative
"When I initially installed the app I would have given it 4 stars. But now every time I attempt to choose a flight to book I always get an error message saying ""Oops! We're sorry...no flight search results matching the criteria could be found. Even deleted and reinstalled the app. Continue to get the same message. I use a Samsung S10.",Negative
"Terrible experience!!!!! All the information I had to reenter since I did that months ago! Time consuming and for that matter nerv wrecking! What is the purpose of an app if it does ask for the exact same information I have already entered? Gladly, I was at home so I could gather all the information I have already entered. Just to be sure, I did screenshots of the boarding passes since I have learned that a few passengers ran into issues with boarding passes not appearing. Delta, you can definitely do better > I am rooting for you guys!",Negative
"Kept losing my travel info. Seriously, how many times do I have to put it in? This app needs work. It lost my ticket info as I was boarding the plane. Didn't have my phone in airplane mode either. Try again.",Negative
