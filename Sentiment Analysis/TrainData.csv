Review,Sentiment
"Update : Now that the tech issues have been addressed, changing to 4 stars from 1 star earlier. The checkin functionality is great and also like to call out ability to view incoming flights, often 3-4 flights down. Need to have Altitude Status and progression integrated into the app.",Positive
Changing my rating since the problems are fixed in new update. Good work Air Canada.,Positive
App worked pretty much as expected. Could have used terminal maps to know where we were going for our next gate.,Positive
"Highly recommend when you travel with Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge or AC Express.",Positive
The app went from very useful to absolutely useless to useful again.,Positive
Finally fixed! Thank you Air Canada,Positive
I really like the previous interface. It was a big upgrade from the old app and yet the new interface had some welcome user friendly UI additions. What I don't understand is why some useful features were taken away such as integrating itinerary into the Calendar app and being able to change payment/personal info in the app rather than getting redirected to a browser.,Positive
"Since they moved to the new platform, the app has improved, but it now shows annoying messages about the need to update, which lead to nowhere, since Google store already made auto update. Otherwise, functionality is there.",Positive
"Loved the new app interface, definitely innovative and user friendly. The animations are quite smooth. Boarding pass details not only provides pure information but also gives flight status which is pretty helpful.",Positive
"Love the Air Canada app. Best one I have seen across all the airlines I have been on. Good UI/UX, and excellent view of flights info, boarding pass and my trips",Positive
"Much more user friendly than the old one, but still needs some tweaks.",Positive
Having access to everything I need in one place had made my travel experience second to none!,Positive
Love that you can track inbound routes. Simple but great.,Positive
Booking references not found? I can check my booking just fine on air Canada website so this app is not working. Update 27.2.2020 - it's working again. Hopefully it still works after future updates.,Positive
Flight details and boarding pass at your fingertips..,Positive
This new updated app has wonderful user interface. Got huge dicounts. Thanks buddies.,Positive
Easy to use and understand,Positive
No hassle app. Very smooth going...,Positive
"Most convenient , fast and helpful",Positive
"Still buggy.... unable to select meal preference (once selected in the app, the entire app shuts down), plus seating preference (window/aisle) has completely disappeared as an option from the updated app? Visually, much better looking though.",Positive
Love that you can track inbound routes. Simple but great.,Positive
Can no longer store altitude card. Otherwise nice update.,Positive
"good, but it should be better to be downloaded in China's app store",Positive
"So much happier with the new app. Haven't had time to really check the whole thing out, but had to provide some feedback.",Positive
Love this app! Gives you up to date status and provides everything you need at the touch of a button!,Positive
"Great flight tracking, schedules and app only features. Besides the usual schedules, alerts, booking, the are some nifty app only features like tracking the Inbound flight (know the chances of your flight getting delayed), view flight load and an offline boarding pass.",Positive
"Here is a feature request for the android smart watch (wear OS) version of the app. Please make the app force the display of the watch to stay on for at least 60 seconds when displaying the boarding pass. And also please display the boarding pass on first screen and allow to slide right to see fly detail. As the app is now, it's practically impossible to use as the watch always go back in ambient mode to soon. Best regards",Positive
"After december 10th update, app will not load. I get an error message now and the app shuts down. nice. I really need this app to work for upcoming flights, this is very frustrating for me, and, I'm guessing many others. Update...the next update fixed the shutdown problem and the app runs much better...thank you for fixing! Bugs were fixed, for sure, no troubles for 6 months or more. Thank you, again for fixing!",Positive
Great service always.,Positive
"I travel with Air Canada at least twice a month. About a year ago, this app was garbage. Now, it makes flying simpler. Period. If you fly Air Canada, use the app. 4 stars because room for improvement aesthetically and could use more seamless integration with tracking booked flights and calendar apps.",Positive
No idea why there aren't higher reviews for this app. Not a major fan of this airline but the app is so convenient that it actually names me want to fly more often with aircanada. Hoping this means improvements across the board for the whole company.,Positive
"Pleasent+easily read&understood app+helpful staffon ground+aboard. I enjoyed A C. this time around,and will reconmend it. No trouble on trip - I enjoyed these new airplanes>A320-200&B787-8Dreamliner-I did research on these planes.I was excited,and somewut impressed. Whitehorse-Montreal. Canadian Aboriginal Aids Network Conference-Aug 25-29,2019 recently.",Positive
good but i wish they improve the booking feature. i want something like cheapoair that shows live lowest fares when i hover each date in the calendar.,Positive
"Flawless, really. Added bonus to be able to track the inbound flight that will become your outbound flight!",Positive
Always great service. Accomadating every time I fly with AC.,Positive
"works great, a lot of improvements and ease of operation",Positive
It's fine but not the best and it would be great if you could save your boarding pass to Google pay,Positive
the app makes it easy to track flights.,Positive
Usually very easy to use and check in for all my flights,Positive
Very easy to use and a very well crafted design.,Positive
Excellent tool to stay on top of your flights,Positive
"easy to use, like boarding pass access",Positive
Wonderful App. Everything at your fingertips,Positive
Very useful app to keep one informed of essential travel information,Positive
Great and Easy App to use!!!,Positive
Works well and simple to use.,Positive
The new app is more user friendly,Positive
This app works great for me.,Positive
great app. occasional glitches but not bad,Positive
Very good airline,Positive
Fast and accurate flight information,Positive
"april 1 update, fixed crash issue",Positive
"Good app, info when you need it.",Positive
Very pleasant staff. landing were so smooth without drama,Positive
Great,Positive
"Surprisingly good app, very convenient.",Positive
Very useful and handy.,Positive
Very useful app,Positive
Good for in flight entertainment,Positive
Very Good app but need more updates,Positive
Does what it says,Positive
I feel it's next generation flight reservation app.,Positive
Works gud,Positive
Like having my flights at my finger tips,Positive
"This app did not work for me for i am not able to afford the cost of any tickets, as a black man. I have a son.",Positive
Great help for sublo staffs as well,Positive
Leo blamed me for this app's low rating. To counter his baseless accusations I'll rate it 5 stars.,Positive
Very User friendly,Positive
Was very happy and will use them again,Positive
works well with Samsung!,Positive
My dad made this app,Positive
great app no problema,Positive
Check-in from Florida to Canada App worked great. Was afraid to try after reading reviews.??.,Positive
One of the best airlines ever,Positive
Excellent went.I am travelling,Positive
User friendly App.,Positive
The new app is lit. Keep rocking,Positive
 love Air Canada. Are good people and very professional,Positive
Does what I need.,Positive
"don't use it that much, no opinion.",Positive
Easy to use,Positive
Works well so far,Positive
It's awesome,Positive
new experience is painless,Positive
very good thank you air Canada,Positive
is very helfull,Positive
not Too bad,Positive
good app actually,Positive
working again.,Positive
Extremely accurate,Positive
Not bad..a little slow. Needs better functionality of the check-in... Should auto populate the reference number like the old app,Positive
Optimal,Positive
Amazing app,Positive
Fantastic,Positive
Fast ,Positive
love it!,Positive
Seems to keep getting better. Try it again if you had issues with a previous version. Pretty good now.,Positive
I dont know what everyone is talking about. I was also affected by the hack and I was able to change my password. At first it didnt work but you just have to be patient with the app. The company gets hacked and now everyone is there giving 1 star reviews as if that is going to fix the issues that you have with not knowing how to follow the instructions that they give you. Its 2018 hackers are out there and things like these happen regularly. The company does it's best to protect your information but mistakes happen. I am sure all of you have made mistakes at your workplace. At least the company saw the problem and acted on it RIGHT AWAY. Only about 1% of us was affected by this. (Probably more) but they acted so only a handful of people were affected. The app is a great tool for anyone flying with air Canada.,Positive
This app was so helpful. I didn't have to use a search engine. I got all my flight info at my finger tips.,Positive
"I love the app and have no problems, they had a crash for a day and went back working fine... I bought my ticket last year via the app and they kept me up to date with notifications and all about every change and detail about my flight, I just bought my ticket with them and everything seems to be fine... With all that said it's very convenient for me ??",Positive
"I don't know why there are complaints. This app is slick. Provides clear status, seats, upgrade info, boarding cards. Great!",Positive
"I use this app every 2 weeks to book my hubby's tickets for work. Been using it over a year and no issues at all. However, would like to see the option to add travel insurance.",Positive
Its been decent so far,Positive
Good app overall. Just don't use auto update on it. It will lose your boarding pass when an update is performed. This happened to me right before boarding last week.,Positive
"This app lets me track multiple trips, flights, and boarding passes. Updating flights in real time. I love it.",Positive
Air Canada actually replied to my original posting and told me that the app could do this if you linked the accounts. This was not obvious to me so there is a problem there but it did work after I looked into it. The app does retrieve my information now. Way better. Thanks for responding. When a person signs in it should pull up their flights not ask you to submit tracking numbers - useless app - perhaps the writers should try using it.,Positive
"Honestly, I do not understand the huge ranting going on about this app. It is working very well, tracking my future flights, having my Aeroplan synced, etc. The features are working as expected and information is provided as expected. I am just removing 1 star for excessive unnecessary visual information... It can be simpler and even more intuitive for its purpose.",Positive
"AC can you tell me why I can't log into my account via the app? Works fine without the app. When I try to log into the app it says my email and password isn't valid. What's the point of having an app for convenience when you can't even log in. This is infuriating. EDIT: Thanks AC, that fixed my problem. Works fine now. ??",Positive
Would appreciate being able to provide feedback on particular flights through the application.,Positive
"This is a good app. Has some intelligent input features like auto-capping names and addresses. It's easy to book flights, to manage the bookings, and to check-in. It is easy to retrieve bookings and to view the boarding pass. This is one of the best flight apps I've seen.",Positive
Works like it should. I manage and book my flights including checkin and seat selection.,Positive
App was easy to use to check in. Used it to board the flight. App was timely of flight and gate changes. App still needs improvements to even stand with the other airlines such as Delta. They have checked luggage tracking where they notify you when your luggage is ready on the carousel.,Positive
"This app has come a long way since it was first introduced a few years ago. Those first few iterations were pretty useless. But now this is a very good app and I highly recommend it to Air Canada users. You can view your e-boarding pass, get flight status, and get notifications on flight status all from this well designed app. Kudos to Air Canada for keeping with this app and making improvements. Good job.",Positive
Works great for all the things it's supposed to. Checked in for all my flights and used the app to board my flights. Ability to make changes to a booking right from the app are great. Can a be a little slow to load sometimes when it's fetching fresh I formation. But overall very responsive and snappy.,Positive
"Great app, well setup making it much easier to track your upcoming flights, manage bookings, and makes it much easier to get from security to check-in to airborne.",Positive
Very slick and has everything I need to book and board a flight.,Positive
great app...0 issues since having this app....love it,Positive
It does everything I want an airline app to do. It's intuitive and easy enough to use.,Positive
"Great app if you fly allot. I feel sorry for all the complainers on Google Play reviews. My answer to them, "" aw, muffins""",Positive
I booked my flight and preregistered for my flight with this app no problem at all. Also have very easy access to my boarding pass.,Positive
"Smooth app, however, when viewing booked flights, flight duration doesn't take time zone changes in to consideration.",Positive
Recent updates are a significant improvement,Positive
Well this app is nice but it can get really annoying and it takes a long Time to find the good movies and I am 11 years old and I like horror Movies so add horror movies and I will delete my comment and rate It 5 stars.,Positive
Excellent work! Love the standby and import booking features!,Positive
"Saying network not available... while I have full WiFi signals Edit: got replied, thanks. It's issue with Android system webview. Why not to include such helpful information in the error message? At least I can try this app now. So increased to 3 stars. Edit2: I was not able to notice any important note on somewhere top during the frustration... Please show/pop it when users need it, such as in the error message, rather than let us check the network... misleadingly. But one more star for the CS.",Positive
"Just moved from BB OS10 to Android. The bb10 version was a ported Android App but was a bit more stable and connection was much faster. As for the app itself, it is very convenient for the frequent flyer. Love the standby and upgrade list function. Ability to book flights is straightforward.",Positive
I used this app and worked great and would have given it a 5 star until I upgraded it recently. Lost all my flight information and reservations and cannot retrieve this important information for my return home. I deleted the app and reinstalled it with no success. This leaves me stuck as can't use telephone for air Canada and they have no email to confirm flight information. This is very upsetting to say the least. Richard,Negative
"Horrible. I tracked a flight from last Saturday, and because they use the same flight number regularly, I am now getting notices about this week's flight. No way to delete it, or another flight number that I entered incorrectly. Had to uninstall and reinstall (because that's the only way you can track their flights). Total garbage.",Negative
This is the worst app I've ever used. It won't let me add boarding passes for an existing reservation and checked in for. It would not let me finish the check in process and I had to use the website on a laptop instead. What's the point of offering the app if it's useless?,Negative
"This app sucks so bad that you should consider using west jet. Every second booking the check in is not working, not on the cell phone or i pad. I will consider not flying air canada anymore because of there failing app. Convinence out the window back to old style check in.",Negative
Honestly if I can give this app a zero I would. Nothing but frustration with Air Canada and Aeroplan credentials. I travel often with many airlines and this app has to be the worst. The user interface absolutely useless. So frustrating.,Negative
Worked well until november changeover in software - never works now - need name and booking reference number to do anything - why cant they use flight number or aeroplan number as well - who carries their booking refernce number? Useless app now.,Negative
"This app NEVER works. All you get is ""sorry an error has occurred. We hope to resolve this issue soon. You can't download your boarding pass or check your flight status",Negative
"Tapping ""continue"" button twice causes failure. I was unable to check-in using app. After I checked-in at air Canada web page I cannot add boarding passes to the app.",Negative
You went from being a useable app which allowed you to basically check everything about your flight to basically a bloated app that points to your website. Worst is you are forced to update the app!,Negative
Doesn't work. Keeps giving me an error message every time I look up my flight. I have installed and re-installed several times to no avail.,Negative
What a garbage app. Doesn't update any information (Gate.. seat ) and it keeps giving me an error when adding the boarding pass. Such an embarrassment,Negative
"Like the other reviewers, the app is very difficult as every step taken results in a message informing me that the session is no longer available. Check-in online is easier but another barrier is the app is not compatible on any Samsung device (not available for download to our Samsung tablets from Google Play). This is not good if you have kids!!!!",Negative
"Your app is as bad as your customer service. Absolutely garbage. Will not get another dollar from me after throwing up error codes, and TRIPLE CHARGING ME for a single ticket. And not even giving it to me. Then sitting on hold for 3 HOURS, WHILE OFFERING ""GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE"" figure it out",Negative
"Has some good features. Tends to crash. The low rating is from the crash that occurred at the critical moment of check in whilst sitting in a remote, non-english speaking, foreign (from our perspective) country.",Negative
"Sadly this app is close to useless. Air Canada used to provide information such as what gate your flight is at, but now nothing that is not on your original ticket, keeps prompting to check-in for flight, but I have.",Negative
Liked the old version. New one can't find my flights to check in most of the time and when it does usually says it failed check-in but seems to have worked anyways. Need to have standby / upgrade and track inbound all linked to boarding pass instead of having to go through multiple menus each time to look,Negative
"I am now in Dutch Carribean and AC website wouldn't let me check flight status for my outbound flight! As soon as I get to AC website, I get a pop-up blocking the screen that travellers from this country have to contact AC reservation... What about Canadians who are here on vacation and what flight status has to do with reservations? Whoever designed this website is an idiot! The Android app is no better, as soon as I start the app it forces me to upgrade and doesn't let me use existing version.",Negative
"Constantly issues. Mobile checkin doesnt work, always crashes, in flight demands doesnt load and recommend to change plugin mid-flight which cant happen. No advance seat selection can be made or eupgrades. The only good thing are the email and mobile nofitications",Negative
"Downloaded this to check in, only to discover it times out on every attempt! Going to check in using an internet browser instead. Keeping this useless app just in case it notifies me of delays or cancellations (doubtful: won't even let me check in)",Negative
Cannot get this stupid thing to work right. It keeps apologizing for errors but doesn't fix them,Negative
Previous app had calendar integration but this version does not which kind of defeats the purpose of having this app.,Negative
Like the new interface however it keeps crashing on my S10+ with Android 10. Only uninstall + reinstall fixes it.,Negative
"Doesn't show you what terminal you are supposed to go to in the Trips section of the app, you have to go to the boarding pass section and it's annoying af",Negative
Barely passable as an app. Almost no functionality.,Negative
Looks alright but there is pertinent information that is no longer available. Digital altitude card doesn't seem to be an option anymore and when you click on your flight if it's going through the states used to inform you if you needed to clear customs. I'm currently going to Vancouver then Las Vegas from Calgary. No idea anymore where I'm going to customs.,Negative
"There are a few things you'd like expect this app to do well 1) Get to your boarding pass....Nope. most of the time I need to click more, boarding passes, then select the correct one (it shows all old ones). There is no easy notification direct to the boarding pass 2) Show your AC status....nope. Nowhere to be found. This caused me an issue when asking a lounge to print me a new boarding pass. They wouldn't without seeing my status... 3) Check in...nope. Most of the time it's missing",Negative
"The app has taken an enormous step backwards in terms of functionally, design, and performance. Why cannot I edit the features of my flight booked through air canada? Why are boarding passes no longer automatically generated? Why is my name misspelled in the app? On Galaxy S10+ the scrolling animations stutter , menus lag ,and the general aesthetic of the app is visually unappealing. How can this be possible? What exactly was wrong with the previous app? This app feels and runs like its 2009.",Negative
"How do you check-in!? Without going to the more options section? It's under the My Flights section, but if you stop checking in and try again later it doesn't show the option to check-in. How useless! Also it doesn't store CC data for faster checkout when booking a flight. I'd like to see that feature brought back so I don't have to have my card with me when booking a flight. Overall nice looking app, not great function.",Negative
"New app. New teething problems. Want to add your boarding pass? It's hidden in the more section. Which btw does not work today. Hopefully soon? App says my phone number country code is wrong and go into the web to fix it. Except it's fine and in the profile. Clearly QA failed to check data parsing. The previous app was great by comparison. AC, you need to test and beta your code more before throwing it over the wall and on your customers heads.",Negative
"What happened to the app? It feels as though half the functionality has been stripped out - I can log in to my Aeroplan but other than setting my personal information, what is the point of this?",Negative
Won't show arrival terminal nor seats assigned which is fairly useless.,Negative
"Was able to find my itinerary. After opening the app though it forgot everything and now it can't be found again. Tried signing up through AeroPlan hoping to add it online - very slow process, up to 30 minutes for a verification code?! And wasn't able to find the flight info anyways. Don't understand the value of any of these tools.",Negative
"App was ok till the last update. Unable to sign in so does not allow to link flights booked. Unable to add altitude card details so boarding passes do not carry Altitude Status .. UX is going down .. Edit 1 - The new app sucks at levels new even for Air Canada. The QA should really should ask for money back from his/her school. Cannot check in, cannot import boarding pass if checked in online, no connectivity to Altitude Plan. Please plant a few trees every week for use of paper boarding passes.",Negative
"The new interface is terrible. It has forgotten all of my information, doesn't automatically pull my bookings, etc. So far I've been unable to check in for my flights since the app was changed and have to check in on the web from my desktop or at the airport.",Negative
"Notably less useful than other airline apps. App required me to input record numbers for check-in and for boarding pass even though I was logged in and it should know what flights I have. Also, the check-in process failed repeatedly. Dev team needs to focus more on UX.",Negative
"The new Air Canada app loses most of the features of the app it replaced. The only saving grace at the moment is the app responds much faster now, probably due to better coding and integration with the new reservation system. When all the features return it will be better.",Negative
Check in is not working on the app since the last update. AC staff at airport counters have mention many traveler have the same experience.,Negative
"Just go to the mobile website, this app sucks. Wont let you check in, boarding passes work once in a while. It's just a slow goofy, semi functioning app. If they made some tweaks and things worked properly, it would be a great app",Negative
"Many options on the app, unfortunetly none is working. Always receive a message : ""sorry it's embarassing but this option don't work"". Well at least you try but next time try to put more effort in the funtionality and less in emoji in your error message",Negative
"The new app seems to constantly lose my boarding pass for return legs. Whenever on a trip, I can only ever get access to my outbound boarding pass even though it may be from several days in the past.",Negative
Horrible app since update....cant enter my aeroplan number. Every time i try to enter the number it logs me out instantly telling me to log back in and it does the same thing over and over again.,Negative
"Useless app. If you want to do more than just view your itinerary and have an electronic boarding pass, forget it, just use their website and save yourself your storage space.",Negative
Updating to the newest version wiped out all of the flight info I had saved in the previous version. I had to find all the reservation numbers and reload them all in the updated app.,Negative
"6 month ago I gave a 1 to AC app, it was a mess.... Now it's getting better and better and I use it daily without any problem. Still slow and the waiting should be manage better. Next step the visual which is minimal. Keep it up",Negative
"The flow is completely wrong and unintuitive. Check-in and boarding passes under ""More"", Really? Notifications now limited to one option. All or nothing choice. And calendar integration, disapeared? Or just just hidden many layers down in a menu item. UPDATED to 3 starts from 1 because of improvements described below. Calendar synch is half there hidden a few layers down but has to be trigged manually for each trips. Still not intuitive.",Negative
Their User interface is not the best but it works... Most of the time. Just to be safe always print your boarding pass. Also screen capture you boarding pass. They should explain it abit better. The app is tied to your account. Both have to match in order for it to work well. The app works but it is not very intuitive.,Negative
Pretty good app but I find it ridiculous that it orders boarding passes with the oldest on top. I have to scroll through many old boarding passes to get to the one I need,Negative
"Would think that you can add Star Alliance loyalty program number, not everyone wants Aeroplan points..... Also can't add reservations ... Need to fix this.",Negative
UPDATED: March 17th. Finally can add existing reservations. Let's give it a month and see if it gets more than 3 stars.,Negative
"Is there any way I can select the seat from the app before check-in? The seat selection feature was there in old app version, but I cant find it in the new app version.",Negative
"Over all good but, could be better for sure..",Negative
I was surprised to see that there was no biometric authentication option in this new update(Nov 2019). I wish they bring it back! Should have more than just three airport maps or atleast list all the lounges and AC facilities around the globe with an option to purchase one-time passes in the app. Integration with Google services like Google Pay to store the boarding passes and Calendar sync for trips. The developer should also consider combining the Rouge Player app with this one.,Negative
"The new app is not pleasing, I was asked to be a participant in the beta but the download never worked in the first place. The old app was great either but I'm hoping that there is some upgrades in the future. Integration with altitude is Zero it seems. Not sure what the big plan is for the future but I hope we step it up a bit.",Negative
"App requires start through the Google Play only. No indcation of altitude status. It would be helpf to have status indication instaed having plastic card. - helpful to have indication of gate for boarding; luggage carousel when arrived. - also would be cool to have boarding started notification and also an option to identify yourself (fot example when boarding already started, but you still have distance to walk to the gate...) - Indication of check-in/luggage drop-off counters would be useful.",Negative
Missing the time until next flight (hour and minutes) on the new app.. the old one had it and it was great when you had delays and tight connections. This information should be located on the first tab when the app is open. Please add this feature back,Negative
"sorta ok but some procedures aren't intuitive. looks like programmers never 'test drove' this thing. and AC is VERY slow in announcing flight delays & cancellations,lll & equipment & gate changes. WITH DUMB NOV 2019 APP UPDATE CAN ONLY SEARCH FLIGHTS UP TO THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE!!!!",Negative
This new update keeps crashing. Really great news for me as I have a flight in 6 hours and can't retrieve my boarding pass. Well done AC.,Negative
"Latest version of the app (v 5.0.1, 2019-11-15) force closes immediately after opening app. App is currently unusable. Using a Pixel 2XL on Android 10. Please fix the app.",Negative
"The new app looks like a great improvement, all except one huge issue. It does not bring over previously saved trips. Huge annoyance, that is a easy fix for the developers.",Negative
This version of the app seems to be a shell of it's former self. It works maybe 1/2 of the time.,Negative
App is negligible in quality since update. Used to show gate and relevant info but not anymore. Please consider a valuable update that is beneficial to the user community,Negative
There are continued bugs with partner elite status not being recognised and seat assignment issues.,Negative
Not saving trip bookings have to re-add every time i assume it will impact flight notifications,Negative
It should not take 3 taps to get your boarding pass.,Negative
It still does not look finnished. It has no flow to it,Negative
"So the new update now deletes my address and credit card number every time. Huge pain. Please fix. Really big fan of bringing the calendar sync option back. Thank you. That really helps with my planning for conference call and also looking back to see which cities I was in on which days. Love to see the calendar info include a little more information like the terminal number, maybe the comments could show the recommended check in times. Good progress.",Negative
The old app was better and had better functionality,Negative
"I use this regularly to show my boarding pass, but this app is very unstable. The looks have improved a lot through the ages, but not performance.",Negative
"Not sure what has changed recently, but this app no longer sends digital boarding cards via text or notifications. Also what really has me disappointed is the Air Canada app for android wear os no longer works and has disappeared off the Google Play Store. The wear os app was extremely helpful with the availability of having my boarding pass on my watch, notifications of flight changes and count down to boarding displayed along with gate number. It's all gone. Please make this available once again as it was such a great traveling tool, especially for people like myself that travel very often. Please make compatiable with Fossil Q Explorist again",Negative
"the app will say it has no connection if it is sent to the background and brought back again. as far as Air Canada is concerned, i will not be flying with them again. on international flights they make you pay for your luggage. if you have a long layover, they make you get your luggage and re check it and make you pay another fee. so for 2 suitcases it cost me 240 dollars each way. 120 each time we had to check in our luggage. i will stick with air new zealand.",Negative
"While waiting as a restuarant for my order, I had to change my Air Canada account password to confirm my booking, so when I changed it, it brought me back to the original booking for me to confirm. When I confirmed the booking, I choose my seat on the flight and only then had I realized that changing my password had brought me to two different bookings for the exact same flight and date had been both confirmed. I was left with $9 on my bank card and was humiliated trying to explain to the waitress at the restuarant that I couldn't pay for my lunch because this app had double booked and double charged me after simply changing my password. Please fix the app so the same humiliation doesn't happen to anybody else? Still waiting for my refund to go on my bank card...",Negative
"I'm having issues recently. The error I get is the app doesn't connect to a network whether it's wifi or phone network. Tried installing the app multiple times, same problem. Cannot connect to network. Please help.",Negative
Some things work well. But the chekin process is full of bugs. Seats won't carry to flight. Group notification will ONLY take the first person. Changing a person checkin will auto assign individual notification using another peraon's email. And I'm just getting started. A little QA wouldn't hurt.,Negative
I am disappointed with this app! good thing i had screenshot my boarding pass. Went to the airport and went to the original gate only to find out that they have switched to another gate. I could not get this new information because every time i click to view boarding pass app crashes.,Negative 
"It is not user friendly. It doesn't go to the next screen properly & sometimes makes using it a challenge. I have tried to make a reservation several times but when I select a flight, it takes me to another screen & wants me to upgrade. I can't get out of that upgrade screen to move forward. Ergo, I may have to switch airlines to book my trip..",Negative

I think Delta has a great app. Thanks Delta!,Positive
Garbage - keeps losing my trips when I'm logged in,Negative 
The app should display your upcoming flight details. Other airlines show your bookings in the app. This app requires you to enter the booking reference first to find your booking which means you have to store that info elsewhere. Should be a one stop shop for your Delta flight.,Negative 
I have yet to remember an app that would be so confusing to use,Negative 
Ease and dependable,Positive
Bad last version. Use the App for many years and always worked great. Now it's not showing my tickets anymore. I checked in on the website and the app keeps asking for a check in. When you go through that it gives an error message at the end...and still no ticket. Horrible,Negative 
Checking in and getting boarding passes went well but the app gave me several incorrect flight updates and sent me to the wrong baggage carousel. It consistently wouldn't recognize my e-mail as valid despite sending me emails to that address.,Negative 
I can't download it My phone has a time out. I would have to sit and click download all day. It's saying 3. I would give it a 1. Love the airline. Hate the app.,Negative 
"I always fly Delta, and their app makes flying with them even easier! I'm typing this sitting on my plane right now. I was lucky to actually make it on, Delta's app updated me constantly on what was going on with my flights so I was able to go straight from my VERY delayed flight to my next flight without having to stop at the board. Saving me that time allowed me to make it to the last of the boarding and I'm able to get to my destination on time. The app also updated me on my luggage so I know it's here with me on the plane and not going to some other destination or lost in transit. It has the digital boarding pass as well so you don't have to worry about losing it in the airport, I personally always print out my boarding pass as well (mostly as travel keepsakes). If you fly with Delta it really pays to have the app. It just makes your whole trip so much smoother.",Positive
"Generally a decent app for going paperless which is nice. However, not a single time I have attempt to purchase a mile booster or make any purchases of any kind through the app have I been able to complete the purchase. I'm always faced with a service is unavailable type prompt and because of this Delta has missed out on much of my money, Lol. I will never make the extra effort to use a computer to complete this or purchase anything in person. As a pretty stereo typical millennial, I can tell you that you are missing out on a lot of money Delta by not having a working app. You do some much else so well but this is for sure an important piece of the puzzle. Figure it out please.",Negative 
"This app is far and away the best airline app out there. When my flight was delayed, the app immediately offered to switch me to an earlier flight and offered four suggestions. The service was immediate, and far exceeded anything I could have gotten at the gate or the check-in counter. Delta has also really streamlined the check-in process for the app. All I have to do is acknowledge that I can't bring dangerous materials. Where other airlines use the check-in process to try and sell you upgrades, Delta has simply streamlined theres for efficiency. I'm consistently impressed by this application.",Positive
"App continually crashes. More often than not, I can't even make a reservation. My reservation has been lost along with my boarding pass at the most inconvenient times. Better get a hard copy of your boarding pass because you can't depend on the app having it.",Negative 
Love delta best airline!,Positive
"We all need one primary thing from an airline app, and that's our boarding pass. This is not immediately nor really available from the app. It was easier to use their clunky website and get my boarding passes texts to my phone. I've never uninstalled an app so fast, never found an app so useless. It looks like it's loaded with features, yet nothing I need is contained within.",Negative 
"The app is a bit frustrating really. On my phone the dialogue boxes don't line up in the frame, so you can't select anything, I have to go in as a guest, because it doesn't accept my account information, and when I do things like reset my password, the app says that the functionality is unavailable and to try again later. Dissappointed. Apps like this can be a great help when traveling, and just make things so much more simple. Hoping these get fixed.",Negative 
"I've used this app for years, and it's always been great. Now, with my. latest trip it was showing my flight as being 'Today' even though it wasn't for 24 hours, and when I approached the gate to enter, the boarding pass disappeared. Not cool. It seems to have some issue with the Time Zone perhaps? Never had an issue until now. But, I could see how it could be a major issue if you are just entering security when it goes away -- luckily for. me I just had the gate agent print a boarding pass for me. Fix this!",Negative 
"Boarding passes for the right flight automatically showed as if I was flying a day early. Then, on the right day I had to search to find the boarding pass. It found it and I was able to use it to get through security. Then, literally while three steps from the gate the pass disappeared and told me I had no flights that day. Time to uninstall and find an airline that can manage their app.",Negative 
Cool idea but execution is bad. It keeps losing by boarding passes.,Negative 
"Terrible. half the time when you open the app to view your trip information, it doesn't pull it up. Rather, it asks for your flight number and confirmation. While you are already logged in... Why do they think I got this app? So i have that information handy! I can't tell you how many times i have stood in line to board, only to get to the front and need 5 minutes to look up my information. separately.",Negative 
"Awful. Love the layout and the look, but it often crashes and/or just doesn't work. Trying to change my seat from the boarding pass screen ALWAYS crashes. Doing it from my trips usually works, but overall its no longer dependable even for a boarding pass. Too often, I've gotten into the boarding area (SKY btw) and the boarding pass disappears and i have to step aside and wait until the gate agent can manually check me in. By then they've boarded the whole plane, it's just ridiculous.",Negative 
"Oooweee, I'm a bit new to Delta and this is my first time using the app. It is some hot garbage. Can't just view my trip without inputting conf#, try to check in but get the ""one of the legs of your trip requires a gate agent"" but it keeps kicking me back, so no mobile boarding pass. Gate changed and 20 min later we're still waiting to take off; no updates on either from the app. But I can ""track"" my bag! ?? What a turd.",Negative 
"The phone app is great, the WearOS app not so much. The WearOS app will stay on and not show the boarding pass well (white screen most of the time and not the QR boarding pass code). Also, with the new WearOS 2.0 upgrade, this app caused the watch to constantly crash this morning every 30-45 seconds. Uninstalling the watch app brought stability back to the watch.",Negative 
"Okay help tool, don't depend on it. While I was flying, Delta sput me out on my transfer airport with 10 minutes until boarding at the opposite side of the airport and I still had to go through passport check. I know that is not the fault of the app, but it certainly didn't make it any easier that I had to hunt down an airport employee, that didn't send me away because of my young age, to ""discover"" what my boarding gate is, since the app didn't display it. It also ""forgot"" my flights...",Negative 
"Undo your changes! When my screen times out i have to relaunch the app. This is a huge inconvenience when boarding, going through security or even searching fights. This a relatively recent change that is a big pain. If I have the boarding pass up and the screen times out I should not have to go back to the beginning to relaunch the app and then wait for the QR code to pop up just to go through secure or boarding. Please go back to prior functionality that leaves you where you left off.",Negative 
App requires a good deal more attention in order to make it functional. App regularly requires me to re-check in in order to access my boarding pass which has caused numerous frustrations while boarding in airports with poor connectivity. This is a major bug that needs to be addressed.,Negative 
Awesome service great flights,Positive
"I rated the app one star for one reason. It doesn't save my boarding pass. It says i don't have any current trips and I have to search for it via my name and confirmation number every time I open the app. This is a huge pain while traveling in the airport because I have to keep pulling it up. The boarding pass and trip is such a basic thing it should not disappear from the app. Honestly, it created such an issue while going through security that I don't think I'll be flying Delta anymore.",Negative 
The app hasn't been reliable for at least 3 months. You have to have paper boarding passes as a backup. I have been at the gate on a connecting flight and your boarding pass disappears. It says that you have no flights scheduled. Then you are holding up the line. It is very frustrating. I have reported the problems to counter personnel and gate personnel. Very unreliable.,Negative 
"App never allowed me check-in; always had to use a laptop or desktop. App ""needs"" access to GPS location for some reason but couldn't possibly rely on phone's provider for datetime. My phone's datetime updates automatically by signals in time zones without having to enable GPS. App is seems slower now (June 2019) than in March of 2018. App runs even when I have no flights; unable to disable; removing until I need to fly again.",Negative 
Site way complicated to navigate. Takes you all over but not where you wont. Needs to be way more of a simple design lay out,Negative 
"The app works only under ideal circumstances. Today I was flying on an itinerary with 2 tickets under different names. The boarding pass barcodes were reversed - not matching with the names and seat assignments displayed above them. This caused a big mess at security and the gate. Since it isn't possible to verify the barcode myself, this is something Delta should make sure works. (Also, the app doesn't let you send the SMS boarding pass that works correctly - you have to use the website.)",Negative 
"Fly American often, but lately have had a few Delta flights. they're both the two largest American airlines and I expected the apps to be similar. Wrong. The Delta app behaves in complely unexpected ways. It suddenly needs to refresh when you just looked at your boarding pass a minute ago but now you're showing it to the agent before entering the line, causing other passengers behind you to look at you in disgust. This is just one example.",Negative 
"the app constantly reloads your check in every time you open or toggle to the app, fails as you likely won't have service at the terminal door. it'd be helpful to add the option to save boarding pass to a mobile wallet. the application will also auto check in when you open it the night before the flight, bypassing the option to change seats or request a comfort+ seat. once you're checkd in trying to change seats results in an error. they will tell u to call 800# to waste time, no fix in sight",Negative 
"Overall the user experience is fine, however I have had a number of issues where a trip will suddenly disappear. I've been sitting at the gate, go to pull up my boarding pass and it's gone. Leaving me to scramble for my confirmation number to re-add the trip. My next trip, I'll be getting a printed boarding pass.",Negative 
"This app is useless as a boarding pass. I've tried to use it twice, and both times it would repeatedly log out before boarding. lt'd force me to re-enter my name and confirmation number almost every time tried to use it, even if I hadn't closed the app or locked my phone. This last time I managed to get through security using it, but when I got to the gate, the app forgot me again and said it couldn't be used for my flight! They had to print me a boarding pass there at the gate. 100% useless.",Negative 
Awful experience. Poorly designed UI. Slow responses. Crashes. Paper tickets were a much better customer experience. Delta should be ashamed to subject their customers to this app.,Negative 
It's too flakey always having difficulty,Negative 
Works intermittently at best. Delta's website is not much better.,Negative 
This app is incredibly slow on my phone and flaky. I have to delete it and reinstall it quite a bit.,Negative 
"The app works great when you're not in the airport, however when you're in the airport it fails. It either takes several minutes to load your boarding pass, or it gives up entirely. I'm at FLL now and had to get printed tickets from the gate when the app lost all of my information and stopped logging in, after spending several minutes at the TSA station waiting for the boarding passes to load, even though I had them preloaded already and waiting to go. Screenshots are the way to go.",Negative 
"Bag tracker doesn't show which carousel, the airport monitors have the information but not the app. Inbound flight selection rarely works on the first attempt, must reload page then try again. App wastes 5 seconds every time it starts, just to show the Delta logo. Early and late flights looks the same with a big red exclamation point. Clicking on notifications doesn't take you to the associated page and notification disappears.",Negative 
"I use this app pretty often as I travel about 1.5 times a month on average, most of the domestic trips on Delta. The bar was pretty low for airline apps but I'm always so impressed with how good this app is. I can do everything I need to on the app and have all the info easily at my fingertips. Searching for flights is easy, changing flights or cancelling flights is easy. I love that the boarding pass is clear, easy to use, helps save paper, updates pretty instantly with any new info, and has all necessary links like clicking on your seat takes you to the seat selection screen.",Positive
Very powerful and useful app but calendar is so frustrating!!! Add to calendar feature is suboptimal. When an itinerary consists of two connecting flights it only adds the first leg. Even on the apple version the total span of time is added for both flights (I still have to hard code type the 2nd flight number) but not so on Android version.,Negative 
"Platinum member. The App has some nice features, but utterly lacks a good user endgame. It reels with a corporate ""you come to me"" feel. Why do I have to check in 10 times for a simple flight to get to my boarding pass? Why do I have to start over every time I launch the App while waiting at my gate? Get it right Delta. You have billions of dollars. A proper App is a small thing in the scheme of things. You have a 3.5 star rating for this App, and that is generous. Deliver.",Negative 
I don't know what's happened to this app but none of my reservations pull through anymore. It used to work so much more smoothly in the past...fix the dang issues Delta,Negative 
"This last trip had a delay due to weather. The app told me that it was running late and suggested that I get a different connecting flight. It was so helpful and that new flight was at no charge (maybe because I had the insurance?) The reason for the 4 stars is that, while it was usually great at remembering my info even though I was signed in as a guest, it would forget in the worst timing: when I was in line to board the plane and needed to show my e-boarding pass. I would recommend it anyway.",Positive
The app doesn't let me even sign in.,Negative 
"My Trips was the most useful part of this app. now it's just a marketing tool to up sale customers. no focus on usability for the actual guest. i loved using it to simply validate that my flight and seat assignments are correct and give me a feeling of confidence that delta didn't muck with my original purchase months ago. it shows two radio buttons, a dollar amount or sky miles, and a button that says, select or purchase seat assignment. what a confusing mess! sales dept has ruined the app!",Negative 
This is the absolute worst airline app. I travel weekly and it is completely unreliable. The moment you lose wifi or data your boarding pass disappears and the app says you do not have any trips. This is ridiculous - other airline apps keep your boarding pass available at all times. I am Platinum on Delta and the app is so frustrating that I am considering going back to United. Fix this!!!,Negative 
"Most common issue I see among user reviews, & applies to me as well -- trips that I have previously entered do not get saved when I return to view later. The website seems to have this same issue. This makes it so the user must enter their first/last name & confirmation code every time they want to view trips which is very inconvenient. Accessing the boarding pass quickly is the only reason I have for downloading airline apps in the first place. This should be a high priority bug. Phone: Pixel 3",Negative 
"I would give it three stars if this was only for domestic flights. I tried this for my family's trip from a US city to Cancun. The check-in worked fine though I had to enter passport information for myself, my wife and son. But several significant problems happened after that. 1. The app does not provide an offline mode. When we arrived at Cancun, and went through the custom and security, I was asked to show boarding passes. At that time. my cell phone was not connected to the network via WiFi. When I opened the app, it tried to update the information and said something like ""need to be connected to network"". I couldn't find a way to show e-boarding passes. 2. There is no way to show e-boarding passes after the flight has arrived at the destination. So, in my case, I guess I couldn't have shown the e-boarding passes at the security anyway even if the app was connected to the network. 3. For our return flight, I tried to check in at the hotel. But the app didn't allow me to do so. It only worked for my son because he is a US citizen. My wife and I had to check in at the airport. So, it is useless for international flights.",Negative 
"don't use for bag check. error when adding bag w/app. added bags to all 6 in party in not just 1 person checking bag. couldn't pay or correct error in app. CS agent kept talking over me when trying to explain problem, ten min in call FINALLY asked for confirm. # to check prob. couldn't correct either and said to just check @ airport but we were staying @ Disney resort so bag transfers from resort must be paid in advance & are printed on boarding pass. very frustrating!",Negative 
I recently flew and forgot my Delta Credit card and couldn't make purchases on my flight. I'd like to see added to the app a QR code in the app linking the credit card so the flight attendant can scan the QR code charging to my credit card. This will also save the flight attendant time as they will no longer have to input an email address to send a receipt. What do you think?,Positive
"The app doesn't work at all. Had to print my boarding passes anyway because the stupid app wouldn't pull it up. Also as a side note. Delta has been a horrible experience and after this trip, I will never fly Delta again. Delta has forever lost my business. I will be deleting this app. You guys are horrible all around and the app is a reflection of this.",Negative 
I have spent over an hour trying to book flights for myself and a friend and I have never had so many problems with anything! First of all I can't book through the app because I'm using gift cards and there is absolutely no place to use them on the app which is absolutely ridiculous. And then I had issues trying to do it online! I thought apps were supposed to make things easier not harder,Negative 
"needs to be cleaned up. too many tabs. needs a widget like the other 2 major carriers. the app loses my record and have to type first and last name everytime looking for my record(should know my name from my acount that im logged into). just doesnt look clean and sharp and bright like other airline apps. colors are dark and bland. give options like ""find skyclub"" or ""why is my flight delayed?""",Negative 
"The app is consistently spotty. ""We're sorry but we cannot locate your flight at this time"" or ""we're sorry but we cannot complete your request at this time"" etc. Unfortunately these issues occur when the app is most needed, check in, boarding, or at times when the app is needed for updates during times of flight issues. The app should save time and stress for the customer throughout the entire travel experience, but it has consistently (in the last 7 months) failed to do this.",Negative 
Fails to update flight info such as gate# and departure time even though all the info at 24 hr prior check-in and info at airport arrival is up to date. The app's flight departure time and gate info doesn't get accurate info until the plane that you're leaving on has actually landed at your airport. Just print boarding pass on a PC and do it the old way. At least you'll have the info. App also feezes and needs to be restarted.,Negative 
"1. entered valid credit card several times and it gave fatal error and required that I start over repeatedly. 2. why cant I shop for flights and switch between credit card and miles at the end?? 3. why dont you store my delta credit card that I've used dozens of times on your app? I always click save for later when available. 4. all fields required error... but I filled in all fields. 5. app wont keep me signed in no matter how many times I try to save credentials.... Delta, get it together.",Negative 
"A silly app if you're flying codeshare. I flew with a Delta ticket on Aeromexico. I checked in on the app but had to check in again at the airport with Aeromexico to get a boarding pass. The Delta app offered no information on gate number, departure time, baggage - nothing. It was absolutely without value apart from making me believe, initially, that I was checked in.",Negative 
"This app was great until this morning when I was getting ready to go through airport security. I had it up on my phone and when I pulled it up, the app said it was temporarily unavailable. I couldn't get it to work that I had to go back to the ticket counter and have them print them off! I had almost missed my flight. So disappointing.",Negative 
"I mean, it does the job... sometimes. For a nationwide/international company, this app is pretty sub-par. It frequently logs you out, using a password manager seems to not allow you to log in, seat map and selection screens don't work all the time, and it generally feels sluggish. Pared with the awkward feel of the user experience and it leaves you with a bad taste in the mouth before you even get to the airport. It's a shame, really. Especially when United's app does the same but *much* better.",Negative 
Keeps crashing...did a re-install. Still crashing. I only fly Delta. Not very useful if I can't use it.,Negative 
"Good app, does what I want when I need it",Positive
"I just returned from a trip. I flew on 4/17 and 4/24. I managed 4 boarding passes with TSA on the phone. on 4/17, just as we were about to board, the boarding passes completely disappeared from the app. just not there. caused a delay, had to provide my license, they had to print 4 boarding passes. I chalked it up to a glitch. A week later it was time to board 4 people again. I loaded the app before security and the boarding passes were there. I hung out at the airport for an hour before boarding and they ere there. I was checking all of the time because of the previous experience, but was confident it was a glitch. Guess what, right as my zone MAIN1 was boarding again, they disappeared. Nothing I tried to do worked. I logged out and back in, i tried to search for boarding passes via confirmation, i even restarted my phone and they were GONE!!!! How frustrating! what's the point? Luckily, i used the screenshots this time, but the bottom line is THE APP CAN'T BE TRUSTED. Don't even get me started on the old broken down plane I flew on.",Negative 
"nothing like getting to the front if the security line for a flight you are already late for, and your boarding pass disappearing from your screen as you're about to scan it. got a message saying no travel plans found for traveler. had to run out grab a pass from a kiosk, wait in line again and barely made my flight. this app is extremely unreliable. also cant do same day flight changes from app.",Negative 
"The Fly Delta app is beneficial to every type of traveler. As a leisure-traveler and Medallion member, the Fly Delta app provides updated on the go information that's relevant to what I'm doing.

Flight updates and alerts such as time changes, gate changes, boarding starting, and cancellations are delivered instantly.",Negative 
Love the app hate the bugs. its essentially a great app but when switching from cellular to wifi or just the opposite and the app is open it wipes out all of your saved trips. if you use the back button or force close app it also erases. seems to only be an android issue. it's extremely frustrating when you are in line with TSA qnd you lose your boarding pass,Negative 
"the app constantly boots you so you have to log in every time you use it. It also frequently rejects correct log in information - i couldn't log in with a password i had written down the last time i changed it, then was forced to change my password, which was then also rejected flying is stressful enough without being locked out of your account before your flight every time",Negative 
"For at least 4 months this app has not allowed me to book travel through it and won't remember my Delta Amex info. I haven't written review because Delta's usually on top of things, but this is rediculous. I go through all steps of the purchase until where i enter new credit card and click the Buy button. It tells me I need to fill in all fields to continue and vacates what I've put in the security code field. I then re-type my security code and it does it again, always deleting what I've typed.",Negative 
"I use this app every time I fly. about 4-6 times a month. It's very good WHEN IT WORKS. If there is any sort of flight delay the app becomes completely useless. 9 times out of 10 it doesn't update to your latest flight if they rebook missed conmections. I also travel with a dog, when you do that the airline doesn't let you check in on the app, which is fine. But once I check in at the airline the app should start working as normal, But it Doesn't! It also has constant errors when picking seats.",Negative 
"It will often drop my reservation. When I reenter the flight confirmation number and name it just spits out the error ""We were unable to find a reservation with the information provided.

"It's very inconvenient to use. This app can't remember my name and any flight confirmation number. I have to go through a cumbersome login procedure every time I reopen the app to access my boarding pass.

"this app is buggy and unreliable 1. Even if ive pre-loaded my boarding pass when i have access to data, when i get to the gate, about half the time the app relaunches and makes me log in again and enter the flight number. 2. When flying as a 2nd person on another persons itinerary, both QR codes res",Negative 
"Great ... except when it glitches unexpectedly at the VERY last moment. My wife and I decided to go completely electronic on our last flight. No more printed boarding passes. We both had the Delta app on identical phones and could both bring up both boarding passes on either phone. We thought ... even if a glitch on one phone, we could bring up the boarding passes on the other phone. 5 minutes before boarding we both had the Delta app open with both of our boarding passes on the screen. Then, both our apps simultaneously logged off, requiring us to login again with our passwords (which we didn't know). This despite the fact that the app always remembered our passwords in the past. ARGHH... Fortunately, the Delta gate attendant brought up our boarding passes on his terminal and let us on. He acknowledged that others were having the same problems. The fact that both of our apps went down at the same time indicates that this is probably some security measure from the Delta server. OK, if this is necessary at least, let us know.",Negative 
"This app is terrible. Constantly giving errors and has to be restarted, and has also bugged my boarding passes before when travelling with other. Today, I reset my password on the computer because of too many log-in attempts, I go to log in on my app and it says my account is locked and I have to call customer service. What?? But I just reset my password! I go to log back in on the computer - locked as well. Customer service tells me THEY have to wait 24 hrs! Why even tell me to call them???",Negative 
Crashes every time,Negative 
"I gave up on this app after it repeatedly asked to change phone settings with no luck. Bottom line, the competitor airline apps are easier and don't require this difficulty. As a business traveler the app needs to work all the time or I use another airline. Simple as that.",Negative 
"3 out of 3 times I've used this app, it functions well up until about 2 hours before my flight, at which point my flight details are removed and searching with my confirmation number does not work, forcing me to print a boarding pass.

Happy to update my rating if i can get onto a flight 3 times in a row without the app clearing my flight data.",Negative 
"Doesn't consistantly give notifications. On multiple occasions it failed to pull up boarding passes.

Remembers my info (if I want), tells me when there is a flight delay, tells me where my checked bags are at: if there is a delay that may compromise a connection, it offers suggestions ; helps quickly find the lounge (very important) ;even lets me save a pic of where I parked my car. The only downside is that it is difficult to check in to code shared flights with WestJet but easier than United/Air Canada",Positive
Nice app but needs to fix 2 things. I can never pay for my luggage ahead of time. I check in on the app then go to the airport to pay for luggage. I also need to put my KTN in at the airport and the app doesn't update by the time I get to security; would be nice to be able to add it via the app. But it does provide good flight and baggage info.,Negative 
"Love the airline and service, but I've not been able to book flights directly through the app for a few months. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, as well as confirming it had all needed permissions, cleared data and cache, and it never lets me select airports.

"It's always losing my trip right before I need it. It's nuts. I put in my details it finds my trip and then I get in line... Phone screen goes off and I go back to the app and it says ""no trips. Find your trip"". I now have to hold up the line and type my confirmation # back in to pull up my pass. It's soo bad I don't fly delta because of it when I can. Oh, and when trying to type in your name and confirmation to find your trip, if you switch apps it clears the fields!!",Negative 
"Confusing. Has some good features, but it's almost impossible to find information about upcoming trips. It's way too focused on what's happening in the next 24 hours and selling you upgrades and has way too little useful information about future flights. It's basically a marketing tool for Delta.",Negative 
the app is quirky. on a Samsung 8 it does not all me to purchase flights. continuously kicks the city out..I also have issues checking in. my work around is to. heck in on line THEN it shows up on my phone. All of this defeats the purpose and especially as much as I fly for business and pleasure. I also emailed Delta directly with these concerns with no response,Negative 
"Latest upgrade is broken. My Trips to List Trips to Select Trip to View Bording Pass (4 clicks) goes to a fully new screen that shows a background with small letters about when next trip occurs. Trip notifications are directed to screen that says you have no upcoming trips. Deleted app, reinstalled but this didn't fix the issue. Not usable for showing boarding pass any more, back to paper tickets.",Negative 
"The Android OS app works well enough, though it's not as polished as the app for the iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch, which brings me to my major issue with this app: there is an app for WearOS that shows up on my watch, so I download and install it on my Fossil Sport only to tell me that it's incompatible with that device! It also doesn't work with the Huawei Watch 2, Q Explorist HR, LG Sport, and two other Wear OS devices I've tried, which begs the question: which devices does the Wear OS app work with????",Negative 
"OK when it works but it doesn't work about 50% of the time. Frequently says ""Oops, something went wrong"" and crashes, or my boarding pass disappears such as yesterday, right before I had to board my plane. Nice going Delta. No option to download the pass for offline use which is essential if the airport has crappy wifi. Doesn't keep you logged in, kept having to look up my confirmation number even though my flight details were there. Check out United's app, theirs is much better.",Negative 
"First time using this app and it worked great. My husband and I each downloaded it and used it for our trip. We received our e-boarding passes within the app, were able to check-in the day before our trip, received important notifications concerning our trip prior to and during it including gate change notifications as well as a delay in boarding message. Very easy to use.",Negative 
Won't allow check-in without location permission. Will not fly with these chumps again.,Negative 
App continues to close in mid-season. Cannot file my report for delayed baggage.,Negative 
"This app constantly crashes. I can't accomplish anything on it - I've restarted the app, I've restarted my phone, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. Nothing works. Just a really poor functioning app. I expected better from Delta.",Negative 
"WARNING - MAJOR PAYMENT BUG!: when you pay for baggage, this app will tell you the transaction couldn't be completed even though it was. So you try again and get charged each time. Now I have to chase Delta for refunds - they never even flagged it or contacted me to refund me for extra baggage payments for a previous flight I took.",Negative 
"Loaded boarding passes on the app, checked our bags and proceeded to security. Scanned my boarding pass fine, scanned my wife's, then when tried to swipe to my child's, got an error, can't load boarding pass. Swiped back to mine, same error. Frustrated and had to go back to check-in counters to print paper passes. Good thing we had plenty of time. Unreliable. Don't depend on it!",Negative 
"This app sucks. My flight was canceled and decided to download the app to keep current on my connecting flight status. I ultimately missed my connection and was automatically rebooked on the next available flight twice. I only knew this because I was looking directly online. the app still had me on the first flight I missed and if I relied on the app, I would have had no clue what was going on. not to mention it is hard to navigate. I am deleting the app and going to rely on the website.",Negative 
"This is absolutely awful. I used this app and website maybe a two years ago now and it was one of the best experiences. Now, this app and website both suck. Like most reviews complain about already you need to enter your info EVERY time you need/want to see flight status, check in, etc. It is extremely annoying to deal with. The app is literally the website in an iframe. What happened Delta?",Negative 
"Not a great option for boarding pass. Even though I stay logged into app with frequent flyer number, have to search for flight with name and confirmation number. App boots me out of boarding pass after half hour and have to search again with conf. number. Really inconvenient and pannic inducing if you get booted out right as you reach security checkpoint and have to search through your emails for the stupid conf number. If you can access trip, nice to have updated gate info.",Negative 
"App is garbage. If you don't have internet access the app loses you boarding pass. It supposed to be able to save the boarding pass to your wallet, on Android it does not even give you the option and the iPhone version keeps coming up with errors. App should be simple and have the ability just to save the boarding passes with out needing internet access. Will be deleting the app and going back to paper. So much for trying to save natural resources.",Negative 
Problem all time. Stupid app,Negative 
Log me out and doesn't allow me to log in with the right credentials. Doesn't accept my credit card information. I have to call in to make reservations. Unreliable.,Negative 
Been trying to download app several times over the last month still not successful. Tried with 2 other phones still same issue.,Negative 
"Sends out spam ""test"" notifications",Negative 
"This app is not easy to use. I cannot navigate through it at all. To be fair, maybe I am just use to the ease of the Alaska Airlines app where I can easily add other family members reservations to my phone too, make changes and contact Alaska Airlines quickly. This will be the first time I fly with Delta. I am optimistic that the flight will be more pleasurable than their app. If not, I will be back to flying only Alaska Airlines.",Negative 
"Functional but crashes a lot. Worst part is every time you need to change your password, this app will log you out and lock your account. Then you have to call in to reset your password again before you can use your account. After several times of doing this, I'm contemplating whether this app is worth having in the first place.",Negative 
"I am not able to login to the app anymore. Something has changed. The usual phone restart, cleanup, Delta app uninstall and install didn't help. I am still able to log in, while using my laptop. Same credentials don't work for the phone app. I'll add more stars, when it is fixed. Samsung Galaxy S8, Android version 9 Update July 27th, 2019: Back in business, thanks to cust service going extra mile. Happy using this app during every travel of mine. Rating increased. Thank you.",Positive
"topped working this morning. Everytime I try to login it says, Oops, please enter valid credentials. I can use the same credentials to log into the website from the same phone and other devices. Restart, clear cache, clear data, uninstall/reinstall... no dice, same issue is still there. So the app has rendered itself completely useless for me.",Negative 
Right as you get to the TSA station to go through security at a packed airport is pretty much the worst time for your airline app to crash and dump all your flight info and boarding pass. Had to back out of line and go all the way back to print my boarding pass. Uninstalled the app immediately after that. I could have missed my flight!,Negative 
There's no way to view my return flight's information. The app has no way of reporting issues other than calling a phone number.,Negative 
"t does the job, and is honestly much better than it used to be, but for an app that you expect to use while traveling to just completely not work while you've got a VPN running? Really? You mean I have to open myself up to security risks to use your app? Bad, bad move, Delta.",Negative 
Great app but whenever I'm checking in using the app I have to reinput my travel documentation even though it's already in my profile and when I try to pay for luggage it continually declines or doesn't process the payment regardless of the type of card used. Other than that does everything I need it to. On a Galaxy Note 9.,Negative 
"absolute garbage. the app doesn't even work. had to change my password 8 times. and every time it has said I am not entering ""valid credentials."" the whole point of an airline app is to make it easier for the customer to use and have flight info on their phone. this makes it impossible to even log in to. waste of space and time.",Negative 
"It works almost entirely as it should, but one of the programmers needs to fix the text entries for departure and boarding times. On every single one of my flights it will say something ridiculous like ""departs at 10AM, boards at 1230PM. It's an easy fix and I don't see why it wouldn't be patched.",Positive
"Very useful; lets you view flights without needing to login/create an account; opened app after flight notice, and was checked in automatically!; good that it only supports portrait orientation (will not accidentally flip when you place it on the reader); (do wish it had a separate ticket view that automatically boosted screen brightness, as other apps do, but on the other hand no problems with default settings).",Positive
This app used to run perfectly. Now it seems to log me out just as I am getting ready to board a plane. A page pops up and says 'you have no flights today' as I'm in line to board. It's frustrating. My quick fix it to take a screen shot of my boarding pass or print off my boarding pass. This issue really needs to be fixed.,Negative 
"Always print boarding passes because the app randomly logs you out or crashes, usually when you're in line to board, and you have to have your confirmation number or cc number handy to get your flight info again. When it works it's fine, but I just can't count on it to work.",Negative 
This app worked at one time... But now it just crashes when checking in. So now it seems that I can only use this app to see my boarding pass... But still have to print it... Just in case this app doesn't work... Hmmmm. I only fly Delta due to comfort+... This is not going to change that... But Delta needs to fix this,Negative 
Terrible! I can login to the Delta website and get all of my information but the Delta app doesn't recognize me and wont let me login. Had to go through a third party app to checkin through my phone and get my boarding pass. Third party app even uses my skymiles.,Negative 
"Use Expedia to book. this for just boarding pass. Especially if you plan on buying ""travel insurance"". They can charge you togther over the app, but cant help you past that. Delta needs to do a better job at being responsible for products they sell(3rd party or not). One gal w Delta origionally was helpful, but God help you if you get broken English robots after hours...if you record conversatuons, sugest you review them. May switch back to Alaska after this last episode, but there are some good.",Negative 
"Most of the time when you need to use the app, it will kick you out and you will have to reenter your user name and password. Then it still won't let you in because your password is ""incorrect"". So, you wait 20 minutes, sign in with the same password and it will let you in. Don't close the app though, because as soon as you do and try to get back into it, it will need a password and that password will be incorrect. Really really really frustrating.",Negative 
"Keeps crashing and losing my flight info. It's so frustrating, whether it is going in through the security check point or boarding the plane, this stupid app crashes, can't locate my flights, my trips sucks... so i have to find my confirmation number and find my boarding pass. it's only good for checking in on time. another annoying thing it does is - not update any delays. such a rubbish app, might s well just have the boarding pass printed out. giving it one star because i print it out.",Negative 
Best airline period!,Positive
Really disappointed lately in this app. I constantly have to sign back in and often it doesn't recognize the known password or biometrics. My eyes don't change! I'm Diamond medallion so I use this app nearly every week and it's just not working.,Negative 
"it worked better in the past and has gradually gotten worse. i have to enter my login information everytime, and it dose not have my flights saved in the app when i do login. if you check-in on a computer it does not register on the app. This all makes it difficult to call the app useful.",Negative 
"When i need it to work, it literally makes my info disappear. Its not useful if i have to keep adding my confirmation number only to have it disappear when im boarding a plane. Absolutely ridiculous. Its been useful for some other information like which baggage claim/terminal and gate. They even have airport maps. But literally none of this is useful because the biggest issue is having to readd my trips over and over again.",Negative 
"As others have stated, app loses flight info shortly before takeoff. Crashes when attempting to view boarding pass. Frustrating...",Negative 
"Can't believe that we had to pay $30 for our luggage. Going and returning home. A total of $60, dollars. The baggage handlers tore up our new luggage. I was very disappointed and dissatisfied with Delta Airlines.",Negative 
The best travel app!!,Positive
Best airline app I have ever used. Wonderful user experience.,Positive
"terrible frustrating app. always shows no upcoming flight's, even when i have entered the flight. now i get an alert that it drains my battery, and with no usb on the flights I've had with delta, thats an issue. poorly developed and not easy to use. they should use Alaska airlines app to see one that works.",Negative 
"Very inconvenient app. Used it as guest to check-in. While the checkin itself was smooth, it ""forgot"" my itinerary 3 times. Had to manually re-insert my credentials to see the boarding passes. On top of this, the app does not show the option to email boarding passes! Imagine you are out of data midway through your trip!!!",Negative 
"Glitchy, gates don't update, keeps telling me to check in when I've already done so, and even one leg complete and waiting on another in the airport. Not user friendly, getting the boarding pass requires experimentation to find the right screen. United's app should be what they aim to achieve.",Negative 
My flight keeps getting removed so I lose my boarding pass when I need it most,Negative 
They should remove this app entirely until they resolve such an enormous problem as randomly DELETING YOUR ITINERARY. Ridiculous.. I always get a printout of my boarding passes just because this app is such a let down. It only surprises me when I can actually use it to board my flight.,Negative 
"I'm using this app for the first time. It dropped my itinerary while I was in one of my connecting airports, so I had to look up my info again elsewhere. The app wasn't really adding any value in the first place, so I'm uninstalling it and not using it again. I'm glad I wasn't relying on it.",Negative 
"Missing one important thing. Users should be able to complain/compliment their flight crew through a form in the app. Click on the flight, click leave feedback about your experience, and allow user to type. i had a great crew bwi->slc, but forgot their names by the time i got internet access.",Negative 
This app works OK generally but I have been having issues with My Trips consistently. I would have an upcoming trip and it would not display and indicate I have no upcoming trips. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app without much improvement. Totally hit or miss if my trips are displayed.,Negative 
Whenever I get a notification about a flight from the app and then I click on the message the app crashes and my boarding pass dissapears. This happens frequently and is unacceptable considering i travel frequently. The whole point of the app is to be more efficient and to have everything accessible in your phone. This terrible app is driving me to look towards other carriers and I have diamond status with Delta 3 years in a row.,Negative 
"I travel a lot on a number of airlines. Delta has the best app, hands down. I like the great variety of information available plus the ability to book and/or change flights easily. The notifications for boarding, baggage status and arrival/departure gates are the best in the business. This is the ultimate airline app.",Positive
Had to keep adding my flight info so I could use boarding passes at each leg of my trip. Why does it forget this info? Example checked in and as I was walking up to the TSA check point it forgot my info and I had to re-enter the info.,Negative 
This app loves to fail just as I'm approaching TSA and has on a number of occasions forced me to exit a line to go get a paper ticket. It also loves to lock my account claiming failed pw attempts. Maybe others have better luck but my experience has been endlessly terrible. To be avoided.,Negative
