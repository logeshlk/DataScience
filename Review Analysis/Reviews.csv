The app worked great for awhile, but now I cant even look into booking a flight. If you put in an airport in the from and to sections, it stays blank. The number one feature, being able to book or check out potential rates and prices, is unusable. The app was never great, but if it fails to perform its primary function, then it is trash. Just use the website.
This app is a crash fest and I hate it. It makes the app completely useless in a practical sense since you should NEVER depend on it. It will crash on you and leave you stranded. Hasn't happened to me because I don't trust technology already, but I'm leaving this for anyone who is trying to be all in the 21st century and do everything mobile. The website isn't much better either.
I have the same general issues that most people have had. It loses trips just about every time I travel. When I try to reenter my info it can't find the trip at all. It also carries over to the website so luckily I screen shot my boarding passes as soon as i get them. Awesome idea, terrible execution.
When it's working, it's great. Unfortunately, seems to not work about 80% of the time. Especially if you have connecting flights. Tracks the first leg fine. After that I start getting messages that my information can't be found and try again later. Once that happens you're screwed as far as finding your information. Doing an uninstall and reinstalling does no good. If you just want flight information it's pretty good, but if you want to track your information such as seat assgn. it's frustrating
Really cool app. Used it for my trip to and from hawaii. Has maps of the airports, automatic tracking of your bags, gate updates, and departure times. Only hitch I had was it kept losing my flight and I haf to re-enter confirmation info over 10 different times which can get tedius/annoying when you don't know where the hell you are. Great app otherwise.
This app worked great until recently. My phone crashes whenever I try to open this app now and even locks my phone up to the point of needing a hard reset. Once I uninstalled it, my phone works fine. Guess I'll have to keep in uninstalled until the issues are resolved as I'd rather have a working phone. Samsung S20 Ultra+ 5G on AT&T
Failed when i needed it most. Cant get boarding passes as it says my next flight is more than 24 hours away. Not true. The return flight is mire than 24 hrs away but the next flight is in 3 hrs and still doesnt work. Did not have this problem on previous versions
Generally 'stale', not dynamic app - fails at giving passengers up tp date info. Ex1; Does not provide or update gate information (even 30min from departure time). Ex2: cannot change flight for cancelation (though email points you to app to do so). Ex3: boarding card often reverts back to ""check in"" after you've done so - board pass unreliable when you need it.
Delta's app and website are terrible. It never remembers your info even though you've checked the box to do so. Then once you've typed in the password; correctly i might add, multiple times, it doesn't work. Reset the password, doesn't work. I wanted to book a vacation with them. Got fed up and booked through a different airline. Stay away from this catastrophe. I'd give it zero but that's not possible unfortunately.
I downloaded this because I am visually impaired and was escorted to the wrong gate by the porter on my first flight. So my return home flight I wanted to make sure I was in charge. This app updated real time and kept me informed of where I needed to go. I loved the airport maps. Because of this I made my flight in less than 45 minutes by myself through Atlanta airport! Thank you at least to Delta app
Poor for real needs. You think this apps main purpose is to tell you what your travel plans are and show you your ticket that you just checked in with (and check in before arrival to airport, but that's a failure too) but the app fails more than half the time. It's more frustrating to use. Just expect to use a hard copy ticket to be safe. Now, don't say I didn't warn you! Delta itself is great; it's just a bad app.
It never works!!!! Everytime I attempt to open the app just shuts down. Which defeats the whole purpose of the app. I can't book flights, I can't check-in, I can't use to scan my tickets which means I know have to have a paper ticket. I can't do ANYTHING!!! I have updated, I have uninstalled and reinstalled, nothing works! Someone please fix because this is crazy and very inconvenient.
Sheesh this app is frustrating. I use this app BECAUSE I'M FLYING, focus on THAT. As others have said it frequently loses your trips requiring you to reenter you confirmation number/credit card/ticket number. It throws errors constantly. Highly unreliable. Frankly, if you can't get it right for those already flying why in the world would I trust your system to book/buy something else? There are a thousand ways to buy what I want, start by getting it right for those who are already flying.
Sometimes when you checkin on scan your boarding pass for a connecting flight, it removes your flight itinerary. I checked last night and now I have to refind my flight because it removed it. Last week after scanning my boarding pass to get through TSA it removed my flight from the app. Other than that it works, but that's an essential part of the app.
Average. I like it, like how it has the maps on most airports, but I HATE the fact that it doesn't remember my trip and every 3 times I go to pull up my trip- while in the airport or not- I have to look up my confirmation number because it doesn't have it saved. What's the point of having it if its usually easier to have a paper boarding pass and look at the screen in the airport to check flights, easier than memorizing my confirmation #!
I like the Delta app. It has more options and is better than lots of other airline apps. The only thing they changed that I don't like is on the checkin it does not prompt you for bags. I always check one and many people do not so I can see why. Now I have to reopen it to check bags up front . I know I can do it on the kiosk but like to get done before I hit the airport.
The app used to work very well. Recently (since Jan 2020) it is prone to glitches and ghost notifications. Check in gets stuck and abandon the app to check in on website. If first leg of flight requires checking in on partner airline (KLM) the app won't get past the check in and is worthless for the rest of the trip. Baggage notifications work, so 1 extra star for that. But other ghost notifications are annoyances. Attempts to work out issues with Delta chat reps had no solution. Bummer.
Trips disappear. Every single trip I've used this app for, the trip has disappeared from the app at some point. Usually more than once. Then I need to find my reservation number and search for it again to get my boarding pass. This is very frustrating, it would be great if this was fixed up. Otherwise the app is very good.
Beyond irritating! App erases your current trip/flight when flying across time zones from East to west, if your flight lands at 2300 and the phone is using plane time which is plus one or two hours. If you want information about the flight you are still on, then you have to manual enter confirmation numbers!!!! You would think the app would keep your current trip for at least 24-48 hours or one or two hours after you have landed local time.
The app works for booking and getting flight information but it has some serious shortcomings: to do anything it wants confirmation number every time you do flight anything. The confirmation number is not displayed on the online boarding pass, so you have to dig through emails to find it. Then the app forgets it anytime you need updated flight information (gates) if you leave the app. You can purchase checked bags but it doesn't remember the purchase or offer the receipt for expensing.
Logged me out multiple times while at the airport. Had a problem where my flight arrived late and it wouldn't show my originally scheduled connecting flight. It only showed a new flight that I could switch to. Had to look up the flight and gate info manually. Gate staff assured me that I still had a seat on the flight and that my checked bag would make it on the flight as well. Luckily I didn't accept the new connecting flight like the app made me think I needed to do before I talked to the gate
The app has worked well in terms of keeping me immediately updated of flight changes and luggage status. Unfortunately, it can't fix Delta's terrible track record I've had with them, which meant needing multiple notifications. When a flight needed rescheduled, the app came short by requiring to rebook all legs, without giving the option of only changing the connecting flight. As a result, alternative flight the same night got full by time got through to customer service to change to it.
Used to be good. It dropped out and asked for my username and password to log back in. I entered it but it said I got it wrong, so I went on with my computer and I was able to get in no problem... now I have to get the gate agent to print out my tickets. This just adds stress to an already long stressful day of traveling!
Found a perfect flight, selected all my options, went to pay. Input all my information, and it told me I was missing some information. Nothing was left blank, nothing was highlighted in red. Tried 7 times, including starting over from scratch twice. Finally it gave me ""fatal error"" and lost my entire booking. Am not likely to use the app again.
Nice when it works. But just doesn't load my boarding pass for same day flights majority of my travels. I have to go through their website and manually type in my confirmation to have it text to me. Might be an issue with Android specifically I'm not sure. Has happened with all my devices, so I know it's not a particular phone.
So the app deleted my flight info after I got into the TSA with it and I had to scramble through multiple of their emails to find the confirmation code, which was link which opened the app but also still couldn't find my flight ... had to *manually* type it in...no prob but unnecessarily complicated to do it while YOU'RE TRYING TO CATCH A FLIGHT in a crowded airport. How bout instead of focusing on things you want people to pay extra for and make the app more user friendly.
Continually prompts you to sign into a Delta account every time you open the app. After continuing as a guest it's a game of chance whether or not the app still has your boarding pass or any trip information in it still. Do not rely on the app to have your flight information, keep it saved elsewhere and always have a printed boarding pass. Very bloated and not user friendly.
The app crashed right before I had to scan my boarding pass. It also wiped out all of my trips. Tried logging out and could not log back in. Tried resetting password the email arrived 15 minutes late. Your password cannot be the same as the last one! I just tried logging in with but it told me it's invalid. Anyway after logging back in my trips are still not showing up even though I see receipts for them.
The app is awful! Have you ever been in a hurry because you had 40 minutes between flights, but then there were delays so you had 9? Well I have and just as I got to the gate the app decided to earse all my upcoming flight. I had to listen to a lecture about being more prepared However the biggest downfall is the way the use it. Don't send out an alert saying boarding has begun before everyone is off the plane from the previous flight.
Decent app when it works. The check in function has not worked for my last three flights. This is incredibly inconvenient. When I am able to check in, the app has a tendency to crash right as I need to scan my ticket. Helpful tip- screen shot your ticket if you are lucky enough to be able to access it.
Good app....when it works! I have already checked in for a flight early tomorrow morning, but now the app tells me I ""have no upcoming flights"" and "" find my flight"" can't find my flight. Not the first time this has happened. Restarted the app numerous times over the last 2 hours..still not working.
I am traveling with kids. Upon landing a push notification shows the carousel number. I click it, the notificatio disappears. The app opens but does not show the notification. Notifications section io theapp is empty. Moreover the whole flight is gone as historic. Aparently, creators always offboard in 5 mins and never traveled with kids
For the amount of dependency they're expecting users to have for this app, it is extremely unreliable and complicated to use. 2/18 -- Downgraded my vote again with this app. It is the least dependable app I have ever used. Constantly crashes. Locks you out and no one at Delta can help you when your in a hurry. Which naturally is when this app decides to screw up.

Really good app. But should have lower ticket prices like the travel booking site. Really don't see how Jacking up prices is good for customers. When you got 1000's of flights a day and puting stacks of cash in there pockets after overhead. But when you got Greedy shareholders who wants to stuff cash in their pockets. Well there's the answer to that question of mine. And the employees are first class all the way. To the staff. Keep up the amazing work that you do.👍👍👍👍👍
In fairness, I still can't judge accurately, but I'll try again to see if the app still restarts after I manually Force Stop or hibernate it from a utility app, adding to the drain on the battery. Might uninstall & reinstall when needed. To Moto G5+ users w/Oreo 8 & 8.1 who reported this app useless after upgrading, Thanks for the warning. Android 7.0 stays on this G5+. Oreo ruined my other G5+'s personalizations😤😠
This app sucks, not only does it lack basic features that the other major airlines have (such as making same day flight changes), but it is also pretty confusing to use. I am in my twenties so naturally I am pretty good with technology and apps, but this one manages to confuse me at times.
The app has dropped my ""trip"" twice now, while I'm traveling with the trip... Forcing me to switch to paper tickets, when the app is supposed to eliminate that... Also it doesn't indicate TSA pre check... What is the purpose of an app if it doesn't even do the basic things its supposed to do... Ie show an electronic ticket with all pertinent information

What a horrible experience to have your boarding passes all loaded up then as you race to your next flight and you open this app to find the boarding passes are gone and you have to go hunting for your confirmation email or see an attendant. Of all the airline apps I use I have never seen this other than on Delta.
I have used this app for years and never had any issues until recently. TSA Precheck is not showing on my mobile device boarding pass, but it does show on the paper boarding pass when i go to the counter and have them print it. I have had this problem with the past 3 flights in a row.
App is not easy to use. When you call, they suggest you modify or cancel your flight online BUT that doesn't even work and they ask you to call. It's a big circle of nothing working!
I've used the app for 3 trips, so far. At the end of two of them, in My Trips, my trip info had been cleared as if my trip is over. I'm currently reviewing this app while waiting for my bag. I can't use the app to find my bag, because the app thinks my trip is over. Edit: still useless upon arrival
Was not able to Check-in through the app for either of my flights. When I got to the airport it dropped all of my saved trip information and I had to reload it. I preselected seats for my return flight a week in advance and the morning of my flight they changed on the app. Do not even bother with this.
One of the best airline apps I've come across. I'd still suggest taking a screenshot of your boarding pass or better yet, printing it on paper as a precaution, but I've had no problems with it and I've used it for every function. The boarding notification is also very useful.
Works well most of the time. Would be better with an option to read your password when typing it in, as on the website version. Would also be better to automatically save the boarding passes to the phone such that it is not necessary to login and have web access to find it again

Why does the app have to crash every time someone asks to see my boarding pass? Even the Delta staff joke that you are better off taking a screenshot than relying on the app... Other than that, the app is really great! ..have you guys tried testing the app before releasing?
I'm logged in but it keeps forgetting my trip. I've put in my name and confirmation more than 5 times, my app remembers it for a few days or a few hours and then I have to put in all my info again. I'm flying out tomorrow and I will not rely on the app for my boarding passes
Will continue to be one star until Google Pay support is added. It's basically functional otherwise, but no Google pay support is incredibly inconvenient and considering they support apples wallet app it's down right infuriating.
Delta is the best. I have access to Alaska, American, United, etc. I always compare prices and Delta consistently beats the competition on both price and value. Unfortunately, downgraded my 5- star rating, the wifi on the past two Delta flights hasn't worked after I paid $32 to access the wifi.
Constantly resets and have to enter my confirmation number again and again even though the app should be able to find my trips based on my profile information. Boarding pass disappears every time the app refreshes. Not surprising since airlines in America don't really give a darn about customer service.

""Sorry, the app is having technical difficulties. Please try again. "" I tried everything ten times and it never worked. So I have zero functionality.
Strange that so many people are having trouble with this app, because mine works perfectly. I absolutely love it. It's a great travel sidekick and even keeps track of my bags. My favorite flight app, developed for my all time favorite airline.
The app was great but the update often shows no flights at crucial times such as when making a connection. Also my husband and I have 2 different sky miles accounts yet his flights and boarding passes show in his and mine, on 2 separate phones. Something is wrong.
It has all the functions it should, but it is consistently forgetting my trips. I'll be in the middle of a trip looking for my connecting flight info and be forced to re enter my information multiple times per trip. Extremely annoying.
Over the last few trips it asks me to check in, then usually tells me it's broken or I'm not allowed to check in because of my ticket type. Don't ask me to check in using the app if I can't check in using the app.
Terrible app. Its 2020 why do you still need my confirmation number to find my trips? Show me what I've booked already. Your app is terrible. Southwest can show me upcoming trips, why is your app so far behind? No funding? Do better.
It's Delta with a d not fly with an f when I look for this app. All searching by fly does is make me a annoyed. Tell the marketing genius who thought about that it doesn't actually trick anyone into flying more
Keeps saying I hit my limit on password entries even right after I update my password, so it's an endless cycle. I have better luck going directly to the site via a browser.
When it works it's fine, but frequently loses track of upcoming trips. Frustrating when you're about to board and suddenly no longer have a boarding pass.
Often flight info just disappears forcing to use ""Find My Trip"" again. Unable to view seat availability when flight is operated by a partner airlines.

Great app but 1 star because it keeps removing my boarding pass when I need it most, right before my flight. I have to keep adding in the conformation code. I'll give 5 stars once fixed.
Replacing humans. Delta is pushing this app as a convenience. But when the app says they cancelled your flight, and wait times are over an hour on the phone... How is this app helpful? Delta, we want to talk with real humans. Truthfully, delta appears best shamed into response on Twitter. Which is super sad... That only public lambasting can spur them to response. But at least there is a human on Twitter. Even if only one for every ten conversations.
I used to use delta app 3-4years ago and it was great. Recently started to fly them again and the app won't keep me logged it or pull up my flights unless I use my record locator each time. Very frustrating.

My flight got delayed no big deal. But the app won't tell me what my new flight is or where the gate got changed to. It shows tomorrow flight but that one doesn't help me today.
Exceptional application, informs you of everything you need to know about your flight, baggage loading, boarding time and which gate your flight is arriving and departing. A++ One of the many reasons I fly Delta.
I am a Sky Miles member. I am using this app for the first time. I am traveling tomorrow. I am checked in and feel great! Using the app takes away stress of travel. I also fly needs assistance, so I can be sure there will be travel assistance at every leg of my flights! Thank you, Delta! You are the best!!!
Awful. The main reason for getting the app is the boarding pass. You get to the gate to find ""my trips"" is empty. What a failure!
Same issue as other people... The app doesn't save your flight info. When you open the app you have to type in the reference # and last name over and over again. Very silly.
Disappointed experience - App refuses to let me login using credentials I updated on the website. If a user can login to one using a mobile device they should be automatically logged into the other.
Not bad does well with standard flights but once flights are delayed the info is unreliable and the system handles these changes very poorly. The only reason i can't give this app a 5 star.
Why does it not show my purchased trips if I'm logged in? Why do I have to search for confirmation number etc. Such a dumb app. Where is the flexible dates option for booking flights?
Garbage! What is wrong with these people at Delta? How can it possibly be a good idea to disallow access to my upcoming flight info within the app? I have to go over to my email to retrieve a confirmation number every time? What? Get a clue guys! Wake up!
Does not remember trips on the app. Also the search function for previous trips to add miles does not work.
When it works, it's fine. Keep getting locked out and account froze. App drops intermittently usually at boarding when I'm trying to display my boarding pass.
Never fails to lose my boarding pass once I get to the Airport. Make sure you screenshot as soon as it displays. Pure garbage.
If I could do 0 I would. I cant even login on the app; I have to go through the website to check-in. Very dissatisfying.
Came back to rate 1 star. This app will delete your boarding pass at any time for no reason sometimes right at TSA. Today it was deleted at the gate during scan.
Horrible. All it ever says is, The App is having technical difficulty. Useless app and you certainly can't rely on it for your boarding pass.
Great when it works. When you change your password you are automatically locked out of the app for 24 hours.
Slow to update and receive data. I lose my boarding pass to often and have to wait after it kicks me out.
Why doesn't it save boarding passes to Google Pay? Also why does it exit the app when I press the back button? So irritating.
This app is useless. My boarding passes arbitrarily disappear when I need to use them and as do the notifications as soon as I open them in the app. It is actually useless.
This app has so many nice touches. My favourite example: weather in your destination is shown in Farenheit. Tap the number and it changes to Celsius. Delightful!
This app made my first time flying in years much easier and about hassle free . Lots of notifs and updates on flight details, let's you know when it's boarding as well !

Won't allow me to login. I even reset my login information, nothing. Completely useless.
App still doesn't remember password, and makes me reset password almost every time I try to log in. Probably the worst travel app I have ever used by a major airline or hotel.
The app of the year for technical difficulties. An almost useless app. Most disappointing.
Doesn't work half of the time . I have to put all my info in each time I use it and then it forgets it then I got to do it again
Used to use this app all the time, but now crashes upon opening and doesn't work at all. LG V40
Tracking map will not work when looking at flight status... when clicked, it says app is not working and exits out of the entire app.
My boarding pass vanished from the app multiple times within an hour, leaving me to scramble as I boarded, what exactly is the point of this app?
The app continues to get better! When will you add the ability to save my BP to Google Pay? Why do you only support this kind of feature for iOS?
GET A BOARDING PASS. Not reliable, fails all the time. Your flights will falsely change on the application. Gives false boarding gates.
The app logs me off and denies login at the most inconvenient situations. Delta CIO and IT team leaders need a good a$$ kicking to motivate flawless service.
Glitchy. Forces you to enter confirmation number repeatedly instead of just remembering your trip.
Terrible at finding the flights, use the same information online at get instant results.
Unable to log in on the mobile app even though I use the exact same login info on my desktop without a problem
App couldn't even open for some months now. Scrap it and introduce a better App. Its a disgrace to Delta's HIGH STANDARD in the Airline business.
Could use some improvements but probably the best airline app of the US airlines. Delta doesnt seem to take feedback.
Was unable to use on Samsung Tab A. Every time I came to a drop down menu it would kick me back to the beginning.
App keeps dropping my trips and randomly my boarding passes. Really annoying when at security or when boarding.
Useless app. never worked once nothing but problems.Had to just call them. Don't waste your time!!!!!
Worst App again.... Automatically shuts down. What's up Delta? Don't want any more business?
Worthless, bidding pass disappears just when you actually need it at the gate.
Horrible experience!! Errors while booking international trip of 4 people, Credit card being charged $4.5K × 3, one for each error, no confirmation email and most importantly, NO ONE CONTACTED ME TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AFTER EMAILING CUSTOMER SERVICE COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT!!!!
It never remembers my flights, and requires me to repeatedly enter my confirmation number to view my boarding pass.
App works fine except for sky club. When I select an airport the app closes. Galaxy S9
Useless PoC. You can immediately tell it never went through user testing. Blocking an account for trying to log in is the most stupid thing I've seen. And making the user CALL?? An airline??? I'd rather NOT fly Delta.
Hangs and crashes all the time, unreliable app from otherwise reliable air carrier.
Locked me out of my account for 24 hours on an international travel day when I used valid login credentials. Ridiculous. QC -heard of it?
App itself works great but visually needs to add nav bar color and add Google pay boarding passes.

My flight information just dissapears during layovers when there's a delay.
Boarding passes disappear randomly. Seriously, you had one job...
Won't show my ticket. It just says it's too close to my departure time to check in. I'm already checked in. I'm at the gate. Just show me the **** ticket!
Don't log in as guest, as it may forget your boarding pass.
i wish there was a button when youre on your way but about to miss your flight lol . makes you go to website to get # but overall great
Thank you for the hassle free cancellation and full reimbursement for my trip to Italy in September. I will always fly Delta
Unable to view boarding passes for my flights MNL > NRT > ATL > MSY. and also unable to message via app.
My ticket disappeared and my confirmation no. Wouldn't work AFTER I already checked in.
This app takes the uncertainty out of my travel plans...peace of mind knowing I'm good to go! Thank you!
This app just randomly loses your data, and crashes.
Latest update wouldn't open, uninstalled and reinstalled. OK now. LG V35
Boarding passes only show up half the time.
Great app from booking the flight to getting back home.
Same story as many others. Works great when it works. Forgets all your trips every day or two
Constantly forgets my boarding passes. Useless.
Finished on first page can't even register.
Constantly crashes. It won't even open
Will uninstall this worthless app once again. I keep hoping and trying this, but it is way behind the screens at the airport
It is easy to use, but several parts of the app simply don't work. Updating my address, for example... Is does not accept my address, no matter what I do, even though it is correct. Pre-purchasing wifi also doesn't work (they want you to spend extra $8 purchasing during flight, which it suspiciously works...)
Great to track my baggage and up to date standby list
The only way to see upcoming trips and check in is to look up the trip via the reservation number (I literally never have that readily available) or enter my 16 digit credit card number...who thought that was a good idea?! This app is so poorly done it makes me want to go back to flying AA just for the ease of use of their app! (I fly for business every single week!)
Keeps all info for possible fligjrs and uses the info for higher prices! Very disappointed!

So the app crashed while I was trying to cancel a flight that's been PENDING REFUND on their website ALL DAY before it leaves tomorrow and when I relaunched the app it had checked me in!!!! 45 minute wait for a rep and he confirmed the static was HIS END and he'd call me back 50 mins ago! Tried calling back on another line and the wait is 58 more minutes!!! DON'T FLY DELTA!!! IT'S A NIGHTMARE AND I MAY BE OUT NEARLY A THOUSAND BUCKS ON THIS INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT I'M NOT TAKING TO KOREA NOW!!! 🤬
This update is horrible. It won't remember trips, requiring a confirmation number every single time the app is reopened. Rather defeats the whole convenience of the app if I have to look up the confirmation number and save the boarding pass to photos as a primary document rather than a back up. If there's a gate change, the app doesn't notify, either.
App loses upcoming trip info constantly. Then have to input confirmation number again to get the trip back. Not good when using it for boarding pass and in line to present to TSA. Also when adding trip to your account, it won't take into account your Known Traveler Number that is already in your profile, which means no TSA pre-check for you. App and system built by amatuers.
There are some pretty serious design flaws. Their programmers don't seem to want to cache data ; if you lose connectivity, boarding passes can disappear. Seriously... It's an app for a location that frequently does not have Internet access? Why design a point of failure that's in one of the primary use cases?
The app is okay and does its duty... **Navigation within app** Compared to the iPhone version, I think the navigation without buttons on the bottom for easy access of My Delta/Today/etc is a bit annoying (you first need to click the burger menu, then select...) - so usability-wise, I much prefer this feature on the iPhone version. **Accessing the boarding passes** Also, please integrate a pkpass export into Google Pay (like you do for Apple Passbook), or implement at least an Android notification (starting 3 hours before the flight) that brings you directly to the Today view - which would make it much easier to quickly access the boarding pass. Looking forward to future updates - and keep climbing!
Would be great if it works. This app has the uncanny ability to lose my reservation in the app almost every time I'm standing at the gate waiting to check in, or at passport control when I need to scan in. Suggest screenshotting your QR code boarding pass so you don't lose it at crucial moments.
The book function from the app does not work. I cannot change the destination.
I think they intentionally made it difficult to use. It forget your trip. give you a panic heart attack when you trying show your boarding pass at gate. it tell you to log in. It should not need rocket science to fix those bugs. Very annoying.
Easy to navigate, and fast.
At the check mark for check-in there is larger font reads 14 hours to check-in. Lower down in smaller font it reads 1D 14 hours check-in. Make both places read the remaining time before check-in. In other time zones that could be confusing. No flight in to Philippines but app did advise me not to go to the airport. App was useless in that regard. App needs much work.
If a companion is traveling in the same flight with a separate ticket, please provide the ability to tie their PNR(confirmation number) on the app so if we select seats adjacent to each other, we do not lose that because of upgrades for one of the passengers.
SUPER clunky app. Poor design. When trying to create a SkyMiles profile, I filled out all the fields before it told me my password was invalid. I had to fill the whole thing out 5 or 6 times because it kept copying info I'd filled out into the wrong fields and causing different errors.
Locked me out of my medallian account by repeatedly trying to connect with wrong password after I changed password via web site. Then told me to call customer service to unlock account, but customer service says I have to wait 24 hours after last logon attempt. Lots of bugs when it did connect.
Often can't find your flight or say it is ""unable to find your reservation with infomation I provided"" even though the info provided is correct. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it is very frustrating.
This app sucks compared to literally all other airline apps. Look at Alaska or United to see what a good one looks like. Delta inexplicably just seems to open your browser to their site, and is not at all tuned to mobile devices.
It's a nice app and worked for my flights... When it actually worked. There's a constant issue with it forgetting your ""trip"" so you have to enter your confirmation code over and over again (usually at the most inconvenient time). Or the app will refresh while you're using it and forget the very trip you're looking at, so you have to put your code in again. Super annoying.
Buggy. Added my flights to the app, which seemed to save them. When I tried to check in, the app lost my flights. It lost them again when I tried to board. I pretty much need to type in my confirmation number each time. Also: really poor experience purchasing Wi-Fi. I bought Wi-Fi while booking a flight, and I was charged for it. The app has no record of that and even gives me the option to buy Wi-Fi for the same flight. No mention of Wi-Fi in any emails either. When I called Delta, they told me I had to call a different company.
The app now logs me out every time I come back into it on my phone if it was already open. Having to log in every time I want to check my gate is insane. Basically use the app to open your boarding pass, then screenshot the pass, because when you try to pull up your pass at the gate, it'll log you out then have to reload the pass. If you don't want to hold up the line behind you just screenshot or print your boarding passes, cause this app is a buggy mess.
Disgustingly Horrible, every time there is an update! Here I am in the middle of another trip, get a ""test"" message from Delta, and now can't get logged in to the app at all. When it works, it is nice, but the developers are very consistent in breaking it at the worst possible times. Absolutely HORRIBLE quality control before they push it out. SO frustrating!!
Good when it works. Often times doesn't work. The last two days, all I can get is a notice that the app is having technical difficulties. I'm a very frequent customer of Delta and find them to be a good airline BUT a major housecleaning of the I.T. department has long been needed...for years now. C'mon Delta, hire some good professionals for the job.
This app could be great except it doesn't store boarding passes on the device and I can't count the number of times I've checked into my flight and at the airport been unable to retrieve my boarding pass without rebooting my phone. In addition, the flight I'm about to get on often mysteriously disappears from my trips the day of travel. Overall I use it because it allows for convenient check-in, but it's otherwise been a disaster for 5 years since I first installed it.
There is no option to save your boarding pass to your phone. This is important since the app randomly loses boarding passes. I was unable find the boarding pass for the flight I was boarding; the today section didn't think I had any flights, even though I had used it less than half an hour prior to go through security. I had to get out of line and punch in all my flight info, including card number, to find it. Print a paper pass as a backup.
App ""dropped"" my boarding pass; had to be replaced with paper. I had my boarding pass in this app, and it worked without issue while I went through security. However, by the time I got to the gate, the app logged me out, and then when I re-entered my login information, it wouldn't show me my boarding pass anymore! The gate agents were willing to print me a new one -- but I had to wait in line, and it would have been faster and less stressful to just start off with a paper boarding pass.
It doesn't work well, it disappeared when I tried to use it.
App is fine when it works, but in both my samsung s9 and s10+ every so often all my trips disappear. I have to retype them in one by one. Imagine how nice it is when you are boarding and your boarding pass is not there anymore... and you have to ask to print your boarding pass. From business class, you end up boarding as the last person on the flight. Plus check-in process most of the time does not get the information from the profile, forcing you to input name passport all of it ... unreliable.
Poorly designed. I signed up and try to log in. It does not recognize my password. When I request to reset password, it takes me to the website, which is also very poorly designed. Also, links in app, when I enter as guest, take me to 404 pages, cannot find page. 12-16-19 Update: Continues to malfunction. It didn't work over the weekend. Now, it won't let me log in.
Fall from Grace... The good: it's a nice looking app, colors and all. The bad: it will leave you at the gate without a way to board. Was in line, ticket showing on screen. Then boom, app refreshed, now all of my flight and everything is gone. Requires that I log in, and after, still no tickets. I'd expect more from a startup, as an experienced app developer, consumers deserve more.
If you are flying Delta, download this app for-sure! It was incredibly helpful. Just show your boarding pass right on the phone. Gives updates on your flight status, and if your flight has a major delay, quickly gives you other flights that you can switch to with the touch of a button to get you to your destination as soon as possible. You can even track your checked luggage. I'll never fly without it. Thank you for making such a useful app!

The app is constantly resetting even while my boarding pass is displayed. To have the app reset and make me search for my itinerary again and again while in line for security and for boarding is a huge fail for an airline app.
Probably one of the best airline apps available. It can be used to book, manage, upgrade flights. Good info on flight departure and arrival, including weather. Plus the feature to track your bag. 💼
I have to take another star away from this app, as the latest versions now feature ""obnoxious white background"" mode. Whether you're on an overnight red-eye, a passenger in a dark car at night, or in a darkened conference room at work, prepare for the pain of being blinded while having everyone nearby glare at you with scorn as you open the Fly Delta app. This app needs a dark theme or night mode as a settings option really badly! Ugh!
When I initially installed the app I would have given it 4 stars. But now every time I attempt to choose a flight to book I always get an error message saying ""Oops! We're sorry...no flight search results matching the criteria could be found. Even deleted and reinstalled the app. Continue to get the same message. I use a Samsung S10.
Terrible experience!!!!! All the information I had to reenter since I did that months ago! Time consuming and for that matter nerv wrecking! What is the purpose of an app if it does ask for the exact same information I have already entered? Gladly, I was at home so I could gather all the information I have already entered. Just to be sure, I did screenshots of the boarding passes since I have learned that a few passengers ran into issues with boarding passes not appearing. Delta, you can definitely do better > I am rooting for you guys!
Kept losing my travel info. Seriously, how many times do I have to put it in? This app needs work. It lost my ticket info as I was boarding the plane. Didn't have my phone in airplane mode either. Try again.
The app keeps crashing.
Unusable. Boarding passes and future trips keep disappearing from the app and I have to manually re enter them. Just now I checked in with the app, used my mobile boarding pass to get through security, but then when I went to board it was literally on my screen and then vanished right as I walked up to the gate agent. This disappearing act has happened dozens of times since the last update. This bug makes the app unusable.
Liked this app first time I used it, really like the digital boarding pass. However my last flight, had an issue where it would not load the today tab and lost my flight information. And have had that happen a few other times since. Really inconvenient to be in line to board and all of a sudden all of you trips and flight information is gone.
Since the last update, app has been extremely glitchy. Doesn't update in real-time. The bag tracking is the worst! I'll get a notification well after i land that my bag is now ""onboard"" the flight. Or it just won't update which carousel my bag is at until forever after I land. Today, all my booked flights weren't showing up on the app and I got notification while I was boarding the plane that my luggage arrived Baggage Claim (in the departing city!). Please fix!
It's particularly unhelpful when you have your digital boarding pass ready to go, you're standing at the gate about to scan it, and the app logs you out. And after logging back in, it's then deleted all your trip information. Come on delta, this is the absolutely most basic item this app is supposed to handle.
The app is a waste of time, just check in by standing in line! Better yet look at your options. I only booked on Delta to arrive before midnight. The other carriers email the boarding pass, making it easy to print, and cost far less! I can't print from this app on chrome for some stupid reason. Going to attempt it on my iPad next. Ducks if I have to carry multiple devices just to use this airline!
Unreliable. Flight information is there then suddenly it isn't. What good is it if you can't rely on it to get through TSA and onto a plane? It also randomly logs me out, and with no biometric login option I have to look up the password. At least they have a sense of humor - this is their response after all the snow storms in the last week: Currently we are experiencing an increase in volumes due to very heavy summer operations.
Frustrating. App will allow you to look up your trip info as a guest for days until you arrive at the airport and it just clears your info and you're forced to dig through emails to find your confirmation number again. It's done this for multiple trips, regardless of updating to the newest version. Completely worthless app.

Worst app ever. Sooooo badly designed. Everything is too complex and nothing is viewable. Everything just opens a web browser that says it's not supported and then proceeds to show a full blown web page. Do you know how hard it is to navigate when the page is 4x the size of the screen??? And don't get me started on how the app still wants you to type everything. You have my info already! I shouldn't have to type it over and over. Uninstalling.
I queued for 30 mins at security and the app decided to throw an error and stopped displaying my boarding pass just as I arrived at the end of th e queue. I then had to go back to the check-in desk to get another boarding pass printed and queue once again at security. One hour lost and lots of stress. Don't rely on this app!
""Unfortunately, Fly Delta has stopped"" occurs every few times I try to use the app. In addition, it often drops trips, which cannot be reentered.
This app can be exhausting. I avg 5000 mi/wk with Delta. ""Today"" screen only works about 50% the time, otherwise says ""You have no upcoming trips."" Um yeah.. I have at least 8 booked. Even at this moment I'm on layover at SLC trying to use ""Today"" for my gate info & it says no upcoming trips....in the middle of a trip. Fortunately saved a screenshot of my boarding pass & can verify via monitor like it's 2008. Also, Skymiles page overlaps numbers so I cannot see how many miles til level up.
This app is terrible. It constantly loses my itinerary and does not like to display the boarding pass especially if the app only has intermittent wifi or 4g. It also lacks a way to provide good feedback on their performance, and if you do manage to find the hidden contact info the response will not be read for up to 21 days. It really is amazing how they are in business. Recommend using AK AIR!
I have a Samsung Note10+ and I've had to uninstall and redownload 3 times now and the app is still messing up. When I go to my trips it shows my upcoming trips for a min or two then they disappear and want pop back up I know they are confirmed because they are business trips through my work and I've even had it were I was at the gate about to scan my phone to board and my boarding pass disappears. I love delta and the app use to be great but now it doesn't work right on my phone at least.
After I check in, my boarding pass disappears and my trip is no longer listed under my trips. I have to keep looking it up with the confirmation number. Not convenient. I also can't see if my Known Traveler Number on my boarding pass. I just had TSA send me to the back of the security line because I didn't have pre check in my boarding pass. It was there on my out bound trip.
almost convenient. Why would i look for my Delta app ubner the letter ""F""? Because they called it ""Fly Delta"" which is surprisingly annoying when you only fly a few times a year with Delta. After that they're a bunch of other little UX type features that are just frustrating. It seems to know more about me and my trip before the check-in time after which it no longer knows who I am or what flight im taking. Uodate November 2019. Still almost worthless.
App no longer opens after the update. It immediately shuts down and offers to send an error message. App used to open but boarding passes and trips would frequently disappear. As a Diamond frequent flyer, I always had to print out a boarding pass because app only worked about 20% of the time when boarding. App is far more of a hassle than a help.
A lot like Delta's internal systems, the app has been plagued with issues over the past several months. Save yourself the hassle and get paper copies of your boarding passes. Or make certain you save the electronic qr code as being locked out of your boarding passes once past security is a hassle. It's obviously not well supported.
Decent functionality. Bag tracking easier than in the website, for example. BUT: a few days ago I renewed my SkyClub membership online (previously done it at the Club), and thereafter the app started crashing constantly. According to crash logs, obviously a MyWallet-spesific decimal separator problem (dot works, comma crashes), I had to temporarily change the phone language setting to US English to keep the app usable at all until I finish the ongoing and quite complex flight itinerary. Pls fix!
What happened to the ""Where is my plane?"" link ? It should ALWAYS be on the boarding pass page! Still having the same issue as past versions of this app - I have a flight today...used the BP to get through security....use another app while waiting for flight to board... Try to bring the BP up for boarding only for the app to now tell me that I don't have any flights today.... have to restart app...miss priority boarding.
Delta why did you have to mess with a good thing. This new app is just garbage. The white is blinding and not easy to read. The colors are just the worse. How do I revert this is just bad. Nothing wrong with old colors, functionality was same you just had to go all paztel. At least allow users to change colors. I been wirh you for 20+ years this is just awful along with your awful new safety videos. Your original were awesome.
Can't get boarding passes, or they disappear at the worst possible time, or they are mislabeled when traveling with a companion - for example, my boarding pass was my actually for my companion, and the one labeled as hers was mine. Completely unacceptable. The core app functionality needs to work, and it just doesn't.
Cons: (1)Have to re-enter passport info numerous times before App decides to save it; (2)Cannot pay for extra baggage thru App; (3) Boarding pass disappears so make sure you screenshot Confirmation #; (4) App drains a lot of phone battery. Pros: (1) Shows arrival / departure gates; (2) Airport maps is handy. Too bad App is so unreliable. Delta, you REALLY have to up your game.
The worst most broken airline app The app does not work. And the staff don't care. Tried to use to upgrade. Fail fail fail Tried to select seats. Fail fail fail Tried to check in. Fail fail fail. Can't stay logged in. Have to repeatedly find my flight over and over again because of all the broken elements. Then I try ringing Delta. Staff don't care. Tell me to sort it at airport. Get to airport. Staff don't care said I should have rang up. The is an incompetent airline
All I need this app to do is give me my boarding pass and update me when things change. As soon as you use the boarding pass once, it loses all stored flights, and you need to find your confirmation number again to add it for boarding the flight. When my flight changed departures, no push notification was sent and it was not listed in the feed. Biggest issue is losing the boarding pass in between TSA and boarding the flight - literally the only reason I have the app.

Super annoying app. This has happened to me a few time. I check in from the app and make sure boarding pass is available. But once i exit out the app and head to the airport, my trip information including the boarding pass is totally gone under ""My Trip"". So i have to find my confirmation number feom email and mannually type it in to find my trip infor. What is worse, once i switch to a different app on my phone to do somwthing else and back to the Delta app, my trip info disapear again.
Can't get the app to load my ticket! This is the second flight I've had with Delta in the last month and can't get the tickets to appear on the app. It already had the miles loaded. But NO TICKET.
Should be easier to navigate and NOT have upgrades plastered at every opportunity, obfuscating information and actions. The web site is bad enough, but I use the app where bandwidth is more limited and expensive and I need to see and update quickly and clearly. An Upgrades button with minimal self-promotion would be reasonable and earn a higher review.
This is Ticketmaster bad! Worked great all week. Continued as guest, checked into my flight, got through security. Then it all went down hill. Made me redo the confirmation code every time I open the app, including after I just did it in line and opened it again to get through the gate... Just like Ticketmaster app when going to a show
Great app, when it works, which is rare. Once again I have put in my payment information 6 times and it won't accept it. So, now once again, I'm stuck going to the kiosk and then to the ticket counter. What is the point in having an app to expedit the travel process when it doesn't work 2/3 of the time. 😡😡
Less than optimal experience. Looking up a confirmation should prefill the user info. My boarding ticket disappeared twice, making me scramble to get the confirmation entered back in to be able to see my boarding pass again and present it to the crew. Please allow Android users to store the pass for easier access. Overall, the app experience was sadening but it is pretty snappy looking up information.

This app has the necessary features to be useful, BUT it doesn't retain the info entered by the user. How does that play out as a user experience? Imagine turning your phone's data connection back on after a flight and having to A) look up and enter your Fly Delta app password to open the app for your connecting flight details. Now imagine having to look up and enter your confirmation number to look at those flight details as you're walking across an airport with your carry on belongings in tow
After the recent update it had signed me out. Normally that wouldn't be such a big deal, but I am unable to sign back in, I am unable to reset my password, and I am unable to look up my username. I keep getting the same message over and over again saying that ""We are unable to do that at this time."" Thats only been happening since the last update, so something had to have gone wrong and needs to be fixed.
Update: Problem still exists. TSA Precheck symbol is too small to be read by TSA personnel who allow you into the TSA Precheck line. You will need to print out a boarding pass if you want to use your TSA Precheck status. Original: App has recently updated and now the TSA Precheck emblem for boarding passes is very small, just above above the QR code. It's barely visible. Security required me to print a boarding pass to prove i was TSA Precheck. We need a more prominent display of this status.

This is the most unreliable app I have ever used. My boarding pass disappeared after my first flight, and the gates weren't accurate. It wouldn't allow me to check in ahead of time either. So basically I couldn't use the app to navigate 80% of my trip. I wouldn't even bother with trying to use it again.
  Worst check in process I've ever had. Every few seconds the app would stop, load something, then take me back to the starting page. The app charged me for a checked bag (got credit card notification), then said ""sorry, we could not process your order."" I had to fill in my information multiple times. It took nearly 20 minutes instead of the usual 20 seconds. Nothing loads. Half the features are broken. Tried checking in through an iPhone, that was just as bad. - I don't plan on flying Delta.
Online check-in doesn't work because app doesn't accept data from an American passport. That's literally the one thing I expected this app to do. Garbage.
This app has in my opinion changed for the worse, it is overly complicated and has a learning curve that makes it hard to use. Example.. if flying over seas out of a smaller airport prefered select is not available except on the return flight, only because the hop to the bigger airport will not have prefered select.. the segment from the bigger airport to the over seas location will have it available however I could not figure out how to get it without flying directly from the main hub...

App freezes up, lots of error messages when trying to check in, doesn't update flights, and after I already pulled up my trip, it will disappear and I'll have to go through the process of finding it all over again. We were so frustrated with the app that we're considering not even flying delta again
The app needs to handle flaky network connections way better. About half the time when I open the app while traveling, I open the app while I have a flaky wifi connection or whatever and the app decides to refresh - and then it thinks I have no travel planned at all. Please keep the old boarding info in the app and ensure a full refresh is complete before you erase my boarding pass and seat number!!! And don't cover up my boarding info with a full-screen loading icon either.
You know your app is bad when it almost makes someone want to stop using the airline. Mostly started having trouble once I switched back to Samsung. My note 10 cant load boarding passes half the time, wont let me check in even on wifi more than half the time. It's really a bad app. Great airline but it's so dumb that they wont spend just a little more of their large piles of money on a decent app.
This app is way too confusing the navigate, the Alaska Airlines app has a great simple but elegant interface. This app is way too complicated to find anything.
While I was in the check in line my boarding pass dissapeared. I tried everything to find it but the app wouldn't display it. I had to get out of line and print a paper copy and lost my place in an hour long line. I almost missed my flight because of this app.
Last update caused issues. I will be at the boarding gate and the app will say I have no trips scheduled. I have to restart the app a few times to get my boarding pass. This has happened my last two trips since the app update. It's a great app, just a few issues since the update last update.
Inconsistent Behaviour I had no idea if my boarding pass would be available. Seems directly related to the availability of data, which might be okay for US travellers in the US, but catching a Delta flight in Amsterdam just freaked it out. Tried to check my US connection while on board, and everything disappeared. Finally arrived in the US and I had to constantly paste in my booking code to retrieve my next booking pass. Very stressful.
Looses flight information when entering airpprt. Appatently it attempts to get an update from Delta without preserving current info, in case update fails. App knows user's idenity but requires user to renter name, email, and confirmation num to restore pending flight infi. App should be capable of doing that automatically. App also has problem taking payment for baggage fees etc.
Constantly forgets my trip that I am on despite me entering the confirmation number many many times. When I need a boarding pass and it suddenly forgets that I'm going to be flying today, that's not very helpful. By the end I had memorized my number because I had to enter it so many times. Overall slow and clunky. Love flying delta but sheeeeesh.
Does not recognize my login/ password etc. I had restarted my password just for the sake of it although I didn't need to. I tried again, and still says credential not recognize. Just terrible.. I was this close to purchase a flight with delta. Given this hassel I don't see my self using this app nor delta in general. Fix this up Delta, I had seen you as high standard and was thinkingb of become loyal customer. But ever time having an issue logging in is not convenient
The app mostly works fine, with a few annoyances. For instance, it's difficult to search your previous flight history if you want to track miles and other things (such as baggage tracking info in case your bags get delayed). I'd prefer if Delta would just leave that info in the ""My Trips"" tab rather than removing it immediately. EDIT 10/21/19: Also, the fact that your upcoming trip for the day occasionally disappears, and you have to reload the app to make it reappear is annoying.
App will forget all your information and boarding pass info at the worst times. Everytime I go through security it will fail to show the boarding pass and I have to scramble to get on wifi to get it back...even though I viewed it correctly 30 mins prior. Why can't you have local caching? It's extremely frustrating.
App keeps crashing. I was unable to find a sky lounge and was lucky I got a screen print of my boarding pass. I thought that with such important info (like boarding passes) it would be reliable. Wednesday November 13 app still crashing. Useless. Could you please fix?
New update has problems! I keep seeing my trips vanish and keeps saying technical difficulties. I add them again once it works and then they vanish again... Apparently they delete the trips in ""my trips"" if you don.t have internet connection and some other reasons that don.t make sense. I.m tired of having to add them 100 times
Like others, update notifications from Delta come long after the fact . I received my gate info message 36 hours after the departure. To be noted, the gate info at the time of my flight was accurate.
The app is good. But the upgrade system SUCKS!!!!! If you have a seat preference delta wants to give you just the opposite. The app would let me go in and change my seat after being upgraded. But now I have to call, and sometimes lose my upgrade completely.
Boarding pass disappears. My app forgets my trip, even while in the middle of it (making a connection). This means I have to ""find my trip"" multiple times by entering my confirmation number and name. This is inconvenient and problematic when trying to make my connection.
It's like there was no effort to build something better than a regular webpage.
It is impossible to see you return flight info once you checkin for your outbound leg. Really? Does anyone test these apps? Yes it try to sell me upgrades but I just want to see my full itinerary but now that I have checked in, all that data is blocked. I can only see the next boarding pass.
This app used to work fine, but the Nov 2019 update broke the app. After I check in, the app no longer remembers my upcoming flight. I am forced to re-enter my confirmation number each time I want to access my flight info or boarding pass. This greatly diminishes the usefulness of the app.
Easy user interface, accurate and timely updates while in flight and at the airports. Check-in is very easy, and I screenshot the QR code temporarily in case I have connection issues when approaching security. If in flight entertainment with Delta Studio was more integrated with the app that would be nice. Downloading another app and waiting for the links to load in a separate window when selecting movies is inconvenient.
AVOID USING. PRINT TICKETS. crappiest app on the planet. it keeps deleting my boarding pass and ive had to enter my confirmation number 2 times in the course of 3 days. What the hellta.
Logging in the first time works, but the app just closes itself on subsequent launches. Therefore it is completely useless.
Boarding passes are great in this app
Lately when getting closer to flight time the app will loose the boarding pass, and indicate you have no scheduled flights. I you have to reenter your conf number over and over again every time you open the app. Super frustrating. Please fix.
App is more and more unstable with every update. Requires a new login sporadically. Travel of the day disappears if screens changed within the app. Boarding times not being shown anymore and seats are not being assigned prior to arrival at the gate. Frequent business travel and need these things to work please.
Constantly will not show seat assignments and will give a ""oops something went wrong and to try back later"". Gold members are to be able to access to seat selection 72hrs in advance but it doesn't seem to allow that anymore, just gives error codes.
Thanks for making the TSE checkmark so small on the new app interface that even with bifocals you can't see it and for making it bright red instead of blue so that you think something's wrong when you open your app. Nice changes, why don't you consider people who actually fly and use the app and make the TSA Pre sign visible to someone who just glances at their phone without their glasses on even with bifocals it's too small to see.
I have an American Express Delta flight card I had have nothing but bad experiences with American Express as soon as I pay off my bill I'm dumping it
While the interface is slick and intuitive, it constantly loses the reservation/boarding pass often at inconvenient times when going through security or boarding. This has been happening for at least a year. Very frustrating.
Basically, pretty good. But to look up your flights, you need to know your confirmation number. Shouldn't need to enter that info if you've already signed in. Also, the Web site seems to go down alot.
Why such important information as boarding pass is not stored locally and readily accessible? Why half of the time after I background the app I have to search for my flight again entering the confirmation number? The app has some nice features like airport map but surprisingly lack a simple convenient functionality.
Easy to use and updates quickly
Update: latest version still has the same bug. Pretty good app, except that when traveling with multiple passengers, it presented the wrong barcode to security. Finally tried the other barcode with their name and came up as mine on TSAs scanner, but that's a pretty serious flaw in the app!
So I'm standing in line, having just gotten off a flight that arrived late, getting in 5 minutes after my next flight starts boarding.. Hurry over to the new gate with my boarding pass already pulled up. Screen turns off, I turn it back on to pull up my ticket aaaand I'm logged out, had to speak with a gate agent to get my ticket that I already had pulled up printed out physically. So that's a really convenient feature!
Biggest issue - the app kicks me out and erases my login credentials 10min before my flight boards. When I go to log back in my password doesn't work and I get locked out. This has been consistent for 2 years of using this app, regardless of phone or app updates I HATE this app!!!!!"
While the Delta App is what it is (a airline application) I haven't used it in quite some time. Today, it popped up with a notification on my phone with the title and text of "test". Sounds like a compromised application; no thank you. Uninstalling.
This app is GARBAGE! Do NOT use this app to check in for international flights or it will screw you and you'll have to arrive at the airport an additional 2 hours early for your flight. Or better yet, just book the flight with American, United, or any other airline that has an app that works correctly.
Love the comfort & service!
This is such an unreliable app. Always logs me out at the most inopportune times. Continuously checks me out after I have checked in online, which gives me problems boarding the plane. Unreliable and I don't know why I opt for using the app instead of reliable paper.
Nice idea and mostly works well. Functions are too limited vs website and experience way too many errors when trying to book or purchased upgrades to seats. Don't offer a seat upgrade and then tell me you can't process it. Please fix these issues.
It would be nice if this app showed a nice summary of an upcoming trip like every other carrier I've used. This is bits and pieces of information interspersed with ads and text. I really dislike it.
Get error messages when I try to reset my password. Only option is to call customer service. Locked out of account. Call customer service. "Please say or enter your long-ass delta account number." Pass.
It's impossible to give Delta your money with this app. Other airlines have that working very well in their apps from my experience. Electronic tickets work well.
Not sure what happened with this latest update, but it freezes all the time and randomly loses my trip information. I have to restart Everytime I try to check in. Also don't like the new layout and color coding.
The app was finicky. The flight updates were slow and did not continue to show my boarding pass right as I was about to scan to board. I wound up getting my boarding pass printed, which is fine, just inconvenient that the app did that.
Why is there a 5 second splash screen? Why is the app not called Delta so it's easy to find? Why does it take so long to navigate around the app (loading, loading, loading)?
I am trying to log in and it doesn't recognize my information!! Has to go to continue as a guest!!
Received a test notification. App logged me out and won't allow me to log back in. Never like the app anyway, too many advertisements and too busy. It's not user friendly.
Great but often locks up just as I am boarding. So much that when time permits I get a paper ticket.
New update is horrible. Very difficult to view now with the color change. Colors are all in the same family, but different shades.
The latest version has the WORST color scheme ever. It is so difficult to read. Did you all test to make sure people with even limited color vision deficiency can see that seat map clearly??
The latest update has caused new flights not to appear in the app. When adding manually, it will disappear. The app also constantly logs you out.
Works well except for the times when my trips suddenly disappear. Taking a star off because with the updated app I have to go in several times until the "acknowledge" button goes through (when checking in).
Why does this app randomly forget my coming flights? And when it happens, it happens ALWAYS right before boarding when you actually need your boarding pass, this is super frustrating! P.S. Way better since latest updates (November 2019)
App won't even open now!!!
A useful app when it works, but it's plagued by menus that fail to load. Check In; Seat Assignment; Upgrade List - all are liable to fail for no apparent reason, even when you're at 5 bars of 4G LTE.
Terrible feature that prevents you from showing your boarding pass to TSA 10 minutes before boarding ends, so that you have to miss your flight. Undependable garbage that is worse than any app I've ever used.
Never remembers passwords!! Has been going on for years. Absolutely will not produce boarding pass when asked for. Itin disappears at Worst time. Hotels have been dumped. Awful app.
The app doesn't work, tried to check in on multiple phones and browser as well, does not work. Very annoying problem to encounter when trying to fly home. Won't be using Delta again.
This app can be invaluable but experiences technical difficulties all the time. At the worst time possible too. Love it when it works.
This app is great!!! I am a first time flyer and it shows me maps of my airport and even gives directions on how to get from check in to my gate. I could not be more thankful.
HORRIBLE! One moment, have boarding info, next not logged in... Get a message notification, check message, go back to My Trips - says I have no trips. HORRIBLE!!! So bad I'll fly a different airline.
Great app, very convenient. Sometimes a bit buggy so only 4 stars. Sometimes loses the ability to easily locate bag carousel after landing. Sometimes app crashes or hangs when trying to view seat maps or change seating.
Lol at the dev who dropped a "test" notification. App somehow broken now too and signed me out. Can't sign in yet. Overall a good app since I last used it. Good features, good airport maps, itinerary lookup, and beats Alaska on their app.
New update is horrible. Very difficult to view now with the color change. Colors are all in the same family, but different shades.

Does not work instantly closes upon trying to open used to be a great app. Has not been working on LG devices for 5 months now, tried LG5, LG6 and L8THINQ. Still nothing as of date 11.19.19.
Great but often locks up just as I am boarding. So much that when time permits I get a paper ticket.
Received a test notification. App logged me out and won't allow me to log back in. Never like the app anyway, too many advertisements and too busy. It's not user friendly.
I am trying to log in and it doesn't recognize my information!! Has to go to continue as a guest!!
Too many functions do not work. The chat feature is useless both when trying to communicate with the botnand with a rep. Useless in the extreme.
Often forgets that it's got a boarding pass loaded and called up, and then requires you to refind your flight and start the boarding pass process again. Pain in the ass!
Why is there a 5 second splash screen? Why is the app not called Delta so it's easy to find? Why does it take so long to navigate around the app (loading, loading, loading)?
I can't even log in on my phone. I am not complaining because I just got my phone, got the Delta App and really don't know what to do. Does anybody know if you have to log in every time you want to use this App?
Half the time when you open the app it has nothing there. Our it says oops, sorry app not available. This is not good when your boarding pass just disappears
This application stopped working while on a layover, so had to get a paper ticket at gate agent counter and still isn't working so can't check in for flights days later.
No mobile boarding pass support
Keeps logging me off and then I need to manually re-enter my ticket confirmation number etc to get to my boarding pass. Also can't add reservations manually from klm flight,>2 days after booking
